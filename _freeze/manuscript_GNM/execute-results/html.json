Nests provide structural support for eggs, parents, and offspring, and protect them against predators and environmental pressures, and are thus key to reproductive success and survival [@hansell2000; @mainwaring2014; @deeming2023]. While most birds use organic plant materials such as twigs, branches, grass, and moss, some incorporate inorganic items, including mud, stones, feathers, snake skins and even anthropogenic materials like plastic and cigarette butts [@sergio2011; @suárez-rodríguez2013; @sheard2024]. These are considered non-structural additions and suggest that nests are more than just physical shelters; they can be complex tools shaped by both natural and sexual selection for multiple functions. Indeed, nests can play a key role in sexual display, and features such as size have been shown to act as sexually selected signals of parental quality in several bird species [@moreno1994; @hoi1996], even interspecifically [@soler1995]. Nest-building behaviour is increasingly recognized as an expression of the extended phenotype (reviewed by @moreno2012), and phylogeny has been shown to be an important factor explaining both mean and within-species variation in nest morphology [@perez2023]. Yet, despite hundreds of scientific articles studying nests and nesting behaviour in birds being published each year, much remains unknown.\n\nAn intriguing nesting behaviour observed in some bird species is the addition of fresh, often aromatic, plant material to the nest. This green nest material (hereafter GNM), which often corresponds to leaves, sprigs, herbs and branches, is typically added from the start of nest building until egg laying, although some species like the blue tit (Cyanistes cyanus), keep adding it even after the nest is finished. Importantly, contrary to the structural nest materials (e.g., twigs, mud), GNM is selected from a small, non-random subset of local flora [@clark1985; @petit2002; @garrido-bautista2023], and often characterized by high levels of aromatic volatile compounds (commonly used by songbirds: @mennerat2009b) or secondary metabolites such as oils and resins (commonly used by raptors: @ontiveros2007). GNM is unlikely to be gathered opportunistically, and collecting these uncommon GNM, and replenishing it for some times weeks, requires extra time, and in some cases flying outside one’s territory [@mennerat2009]. Thus, the general costs associated with nest-building [@mainwaring2013], and the additional effort, time and energy devoted to add these non-structural materials suggest an important adaptive function of GNM.\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive function of GNM (reviewed in @dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015) First, the courtship hypothesis suggests that (mostly) males use GNM as visual or olfactory signals to attract females and/or advertise nest site occupancy to other males (e.g., @eens1993; @gwinner1997; @brouwer2004)), particularly in cavity-nesting species where visual cues inside the nest are limited. The courtship hypothesis traces back to the early natural history observations by @kessel1957, who noted that male European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) carried fresh plant material to their nests while singing and displaying to females. Subsequent studies in both European and Spotless Starlings (Sturnus unicolor) supported this view that GNM may serve as a sexually selected signal of male quality by showing that females often prefer nests with fresh GNM, and that unpaired males conspicuously deliver GNM during courtship, stopping right after the onset of egg laying [@brouwer2004; @veiga2006], and increasing this behaviour in the presence of potential mates [@eens1993] The courtship hypothesis was later extended to explain GNM addition solely by females in Blue Tits, therefore suggesting that GNM might serve as a sexually selected signal of female quality [@tomás2013].\n\nSecond, the most widely tested hypothesis is the nest protection hypothesis, which proposes that the volatile compounds in GNM reduce the amount of parasites and pathogens in the nests, enhancing offspring survival. This hypothesis traces back to a comparative study in raptors (Falconiformes) that provided indirect evidence for it by comparing nest reuse, diet composition and GNM presence [@wimberger1984]. Soon after, a preference for GNM containing insect-repellent and antimicrobial volatiles was experimentally confirmed in European Starlings, therefore confirming two of the three key criteria for evaluating the nest protection hypothesis (i.e., selective plant use, bioactive chemical properties and demonstrable adaptive benefits; Clark and Mason 1988). Observational and experimental studies on raptors [@ontiveros2007; @dykstra2009] and passerines [@lafuma2001; @dawson2004; @mennerat2009b; @quiroga2012] have shown mixed results. In some cases, GNM was shown to improve offspring condition without reducing the amount of parasites in the nests [@gwinner2000], which led to the development of the drug hypothesis. This alternative hypothesis suggests that the volatiles present in GNM directly enhance offspring immune function and/or health independent of parasite or pathogen control [@gwinner2000; @mennerat2009a]. Thus, while both the nest protection and drug hypothesis suggest an adaptive benefit of GNM by enhancing offspring survival, the drug hypothesis emphasizes a pharmacological mechanism, whereas the nest protection hypothesis emphasizes parasite and pathogen repellency. Importantly, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive unless the improvement in offspring health can be proved to be unrelated to a reduction in parasite or pathogen load, something difficult to achieve.\n\nLast, several additional adaptive hypotheses or functions of GNM that do not refer to its aromatic (i.e., volatiles and secondary metabolites) properties have been also proposed. These include benefits such as enhancing the crypticity of the nest [@skutch1957], providing insulation or sun protection for eggs and offspring [@mertens1977], or simply fulfilling a structural function [@lyons1987]. However, these alternative functional roles have received little support or attention. In all, despite decades of research, abundant observational and experimental studies, and two crucial narrative reviews [@dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015], we still do not know the overall adaptive significance of GNM, its generality across bird species, and the relative importance of each of the suggested mechanisms. Given that nest building is widespread across taxa —including but not limited to birds— and is increasingly recognized as an expression of the extended phenotype, a quantitative synthesis of this field is both timely and has potentially far-reaching implications.\n\nTo address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of experiments testing the effect of GNM on various fitness proxies across birds. Our meta-analysis explicitly evaluates the overall evidence for the adaptive significance of GNM, as well as assesses the relative importance of the main suggested hypotheses: the courtship hypothesis and parental care hypothesis (i.e., a combination of both the nest protection and drug hypotheses). In addition, we tested several potential moderators that might explain the observed context-dependency (i.e., high heterogeneity among effect sizes). Specifically, we tested whether the effect of GNM varied depending on the experimental design used (aromatic vs. non-aromatic vs. no added material), the timing of GNM addition (before hatching, after hatching, or continuously), the focal species studied, the type of fitness proxy investigated (e.g., physiology, morphology, reproduction), and the type of parasite (arthropods vs. microorganisms). Our meta-analysis of experimental studies is the first quantitative synthesis testing the causal relationship between GNM and fitness across birds.\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ndevtools::install_github(\"daniel1noble/orchaRd\", ref = \"main\", force = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nDownloading GitHub repo daniel1noble/orchaRd@main\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npurrr (1.0.4 -> 1.1.0) [CRAN]\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nInstalling 1 packages: purrr\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\t/var/folders/sp/jlskm_817d78dg8nvdk72l0c0000gn/T//RtmpkWPOqk/downloaded_packages\n── R CMD build ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n* checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/sp/jlskm_817d78dg8nvdk72l0c0000gn/T/RtmpkWPOqk/remotes9223f4c671e/daniel1noble-orchaRd-20d9a75/DESCRIPTION’ ...

Science Core Collection and Scopus on the 7th of September, 2022 (see update below). The keyword search query was designed as a three-block query including terms related to our treatment of interest ((“green\\*” OR “herb\\*” OR “aromatic\\*”) AND “nest\\*”), population of interest (“bird\\*” OR “aves” OR “avian” OR “ornithol\\*” OR “passerine\\*” OR “passeriform\\*” OR “songbird\\*” OR list of all bird genera) and to limit the search results to experimental studies only (“experiment\\*” OR “manipulat\\*”). The complete search strings tailored to each specific platform are provided in @figsupp-string. Although our search string only included keywords in English, we planned to screen any study in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Hindi, but found none. We searched through titles, abstracts and keywords with no restrictions on publication date or study type. We validated our search using an initial library of 15 relevant articles that we had previously identified (@figsupp-own-library), ensuring all were retrieved. Additionally, we used the R package ‘litsearchr’ v1.0.0 [@grames2019], which did not yield any new relevant terms, confirm our queries. After removing 152 duplicates using the R package ‘revtools’ v0.4.1 [@westgate2019], we identified 383 unique records.\n\n## Eligibility criteria\n\nAll titles and abstracts were equally allocated and screened independently by at least two screeners (SD, TR, JMGS) using the R package ‘revtools’ following a pre-designed decision tree with all inclusion/exclusion criteria (@figsupp-decision-tree). We included all studies on birds that experimentally manipulated the GNM (both aromatics or herbs). Forty articles passed the title-and-abstract screening and were further evaluated during the full-text screening, where each article was independently screened by a single screener (SD, TR, JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure. We used the same criteria as above (@figsupp-decision-tree) with an additional evaluation of whether the variable of interest in the article was in our list of fitness proxies of interest (@figsupp-fitness-proxies). Twenty\\-two articles passed the full-text screening, and were, thus, eligible for our meta-analysis. All conflicts in screening decisions (1% for title-and-abstract screening, and none for full-text screening) were resolved through discussion.\n\nWe updated our systematic literature search by repeating our search on the 12th of August, 2024, and found 53 unique articles after removing 13 duplicates. Only one observer (SD) performed the both screenings using the same decision trees as before (@figsupp-decision-tree), and found one additional eligible article for our meta-analysis. Lastly, we identified three additional eligible articles recommended by two colleagues. In all, 26 published articles were eligible for our meta-analysis, but we also obtained two additional unpublished studies (more details below and in @figsupp-prisma-flowchart).\n\n## Data extraction\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nmerged_data_extraction <- read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/merged_data_extraction.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\ndataset_after_cleaning <- read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/dataset_after_cleaning.csv\", show_col_types = F)\nincluded_papers_no<-length(unique(dataset_after_cleaning$paper_ID))\n\n# Numbers for extraction ID\ndata_extractors <- merged_data_extraction %>%\n     distinct(paper_ID, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%\n     select(paper_ID, extractor_ID) %>%\n     mutate(extractor_ID = case_when(\n    extractor_ID == \"JS/SD/TR\" ~ \"TR/JMGS/SD\",\n    TRUE ~ extractor_ID)) %>%\n     group_by(extractor_ID) %>%\n     summarise(total_papers = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nexcluded_proxies<- merged_data_extraction %>%\n  filter(fulltext_screening == \"included\" |\n         is.na(fulltext_screening) |\n         fulltext_screening == \"NA\") %>%\n  filter(proxy_decision== \"exclude\")\n\ndataset_analysis <- read_csv(\"data/04_data_analysis/dataset_analysis.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\nSAonly_proxies<- dataset_analysis %>% filter(proxy_decision==\"sensitivity-analysis\")\n\ninferential_only<- dataset_analysis%>%filter(statistics_type==\"t-test\"|statistics_type==\"ANCOVA\")\n\ncontingency_table<-dataset_analysis%>%filter(proxy_decision==\"contingency table\")\n\nraw_data<-c(\"GNM_001_rep_table3\",\"GNM_010\",\"GNM_069\",\"GNM_237\") \n#GNM_018 also provides open data but we ended up not needing it\n\npublished_studies <- dataset_analysis %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(paper_ID, \"Unpublished\"))\n\nunpublished_studies <- dataset_analysis %>%\n  filter(str_detect(paper_ID, \"Unpublished\"))\n\ndataset_lnRR <- read_csv(\"data/04_data_analysis/dataset_lnRR.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\ndataset_SMDH <- read_csv(\"data/04_data_analysis/dataset_SMDH.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\nlnRR_comp3<-dataset_lnRR%>%filter(comparision_type==3)\n\nSMDH_comp3<-dataset_SMDH%>%filter(comparision_type==3)\n\nmultiple_comparision <- dataset_analysis %>%\ngroup_by(paper_ID) %>%\n  summarise(n_types = n_distinct(comparision_type),             \n    types   = paste(sort(unique(comparision_type)), collapse = \", \"),\n    .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  filter(n_types > 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data of each article were extracted evenly by one of three authors (SD, TR,  JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure, and four authors (SD, TR, JMGS, AST) collectively discussing and revising unclear cases. We prioritised extracting primary data (i.e., measures of central tendency, variance and sample size) from text and tables, or, if that was not possible, from figures (e.g., boxplots) using the R package ‘metaDigitise’ v1.0.1 [@pick2018]. If primary data were not available, we extracted inferential statistics such as *t* and *F* values or descriptive statistics such as contingency tables (see below), that could be transformed into an effect size. Last, if the previous steps failed but the article had openly archived data, we calculated the means, standard deviation and sample sizes from them (n = 4).\n\nWe extracted the means, variances and sample sizes for each control-treatment pairwise comparison. Depending on the experimental design of each study, controls included non-aromatic materials such as grass or moss, lesser amounts of aromatic material than the treatments, no additional material added, or removal of material added by birds; whereas treatments consisted of aromatic materials added by authors, birds, or both. Those comparisons were coded either as non-aromatic GNM vs. aromatic GNM, or no added GNM vs. aromatic GNM, in our moderator “experimental design”. However, there was a third type of comparison used in some studies comparing nests with experimentally added non-aromatic GNM to nests without any added GNM or in which GNM added by the birds was removed by the authors. In this type of comparison, the non-aromatic GNM was considered the treatment, and we coded these 10 and 11 effect sizes, respectively, as non-aromatic GNM vs. no added GNM in our moderator “experimental design”. Importantly, our conclusions were robust to these effect sizes (\\@Table SX), so we kept them in our dataset, and the moderator “experimental design” was used for subsequent meta-regressions. In studies where three groups were compared (n = 5), we extracted all possible pairwise comparisons.\n\nFor each study, we also extracted information related to the study subjects (species of birds, geographical location of the study population), the methodology of the study (plant species used as treatment and control, fitness proxy measured) and the source from which we extracted data (e.g., figures, tables, raw data files, supplementary materials). We categorised the fitness proxies measured into 6 broad categories: physiology, morphology, reproduction, behaviour, parasite and pathogenic load, and phenology. For studies testing whether GNM affects the number of parasites or pathogens found in offspring and/or nests, we categorised them into arthropods or microorganisms. For a complete list of variables extracted, see @figsupp-variables . We did not include some traits reported in the original studies (k = 15 effect sizes, n = 5 studies) in our analyses because it was unclear from the study and our own judgement how they related to fitness (see @figsupp-excluded-proxies).\n\nTo obtain missing data (e.g., non-reported results, missing sample sizes), we contacted four corresponding authors. All four authors responded to our email, but only two provided the data as requested; one did not have the data any more, and one did not give a conclusive response. Additionally, to locate grey literature (i.e., unpublished data), we wrote to the corresponding author(s) of all the (n = 22 articles that passed full-text screening to ask for any potential unpublished data that could be included in our meta-analysis using a standardised email template (@figsupp-email). One author provided data for an unpublished study on Blue Tits (see description in @figsupp-unpublished-study) and one of us (MO), provided data for an unpublished study on Common Buzzards (Buteo buteo).\n\n## Effect size calculation\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nno_ES<-dataset_analysis%>%filter(proxy_comment == \"use 0 as ES\")\n\nnegative_lnRR<-dataset_analysis%>%\n  filter(measure_central_tendency_experiment<=0 | measure_central_tendency_control<=0)\n\nlow_sample<-read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/low_sample.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing the means, standard deviations and sample sizes for each control-treatment pairwise comparison, we calculated two effect sizes: a log response ratio (lnRR) and a standardised mean difference with heteroskedasticity correction (SMDH), using the escalc function (measure = ROM and SMDH respectively, vtype = \"LS\") in the R package ‘metafor’ v4.8-0 [@metafor]. We specified the treatment group as the numerator and the control group as the denominator for lnRR, and treatment minus control for SMDH, such that positive values indicate a ‘fitness’ increase in the treatment group. In cases such as measures of parasite load or prevalence, laying or hatching dates, courtship time, or scab score, the effect size sign was inverted prior to analysis to ensure that a positive value consistently meant an increase in fitness regardless of fitness proxy (i.e., to ensure comparability across effect sizes). SMDH could only be calculated when there were enough data points in both treatment and control groups to estimate the pooled variance; specifically, when the degrees of freedom (i.e., n1+n2−2) was greater than 1. There were nine effect sizes from one) study that did not fulfil that requirement, which we then excluded entirely from the dataset.\n\nFor the few cases for which we could not extract means and variances but inferential statistics such as t and F values, we estimated SMD values (k = 4, n = 2) using the equations provided by @thehand2019. For dichotomous variables (e.g., number of successful nests, k = 4, n = 2), we calculated the log odds ratio (lnOR) using the 'escalc' function (measure=OR) from 'metafor' and subsequently converted it to SMD using equations from @thehand2019. Since lnRR cannot be calculated from inferential statistics, or dichotomous variables, or for comparisons including zero or negative values (k = 7), the number of effect sizes included in the lnRR (k = 259, n = 28) subset is smaller than that of SMDH (k = 274, n = 28).\n\nWhen calculating each effect size’s associated sampling variance, we prioritised the number of nests in each group over the number of individuals as the sample size whenever possible to reduce the effect of genetic relatedness non-independence. In cases where the same control or treatment group was used across multiple comparisons, sample sizes were adjusted prior to calculating effect sizes by dividing them by the number of times each group was used in a comparison to account for shared group non-independence. For cases where the authors of an original article reported a statistically non-significant difference between two groups but without providing numerical values (k = 16, n = 2), we assigned zero as the effect size for that comparison and imputed its sampling variance using the missing-case approach described in @nakagawa2022 for lnRR and using $\\frac{n_1+n_2}{n_1×n_2}$ for SMD [@lajeunesse2013].\n\n## Data analysis\n\nWe performed all analyses in R version 4.5.1 [@R-version]. All multilevel meta-analytical models and meta-regressions were fitted using ‘metafor’ v.4.8-0 [@metafor]. Sampling variances were modelled as variance-covariance matrices assuming a 0.5 correlation (ρ) between sampling variances from the same study [@noble2017] using the vcalc function from ‘metafor’ (See Supplementary Appendix @figsupp-correlation for sensitivity analyses using different values of *ρ*).\n\nWe originally considered the following levels of non-independence for our analyses: multiple effect sizes collected from  (a) same study (Paper ID), (b) bird species (Species ID) and (c) geographical locations (population ID), (d) sub-populations within the same location (Experiment ID; e.g., birds studied at the same location for multiple years or birds studied at the same location separated by distance), (e) groups of individuals within a population (Group ID; e.g., males and females in a population, first clutch and second clutch) were represented in our data several times, and (f) repeated measurement of the same trait within the same individuals (Repeated trait ID; e.g., chick mass on day 7, 14 and 21).\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we fitted the following random effects in all our models to account for non-independence: Paper ID, Group ID, Species ID, Population ID and an observation-level random effect (Observation ID). Our random effect structure deviated from our pre-registration since, initially, we had pre-registered the inclusion of Experiment ID and Repeated trait ID but not Population ID. However, Experiment ID and Group ID were almost indistinguishable, so we decided to leave out the one with lesser resolution, i.e. Experiment ID. Additionally, since few effect sizes were measured repeatedly, making Repeated trait ID almost identical to the observation-level random effect Observation ID, we excluded it (@figsupp-random-effect). Last, we decided to add Population ID since we noticed after extracting the data but before any analyses that several studies were performed in the same geographical locations.\n\n### Meta-analytic mean and hypotheses\n\nTo estimate the effect of GNM on fitness across birds, we used two effect sizes: lnRR and SMD(H). Thus, throughout, we fitted two separate sets of model for each effect size. First, we fitted multilevel intercept-only meta-analytical model to test the overall effect, its uncertainty and heterogeneity. We used the `rma.mv` function from the 'metafor' package using the 'REML' method and a *t* distribution for calculating the test statistics and confidence intervals for the moderators. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis including some traits for which the relationship with fitness is unclear or debated in the literature (e.g., sex ratio, testosterone levels), to test the robustness of our results (@figsupp-MLMA-excluded; k = 21 , n = 8). For all intercept-only models, we estimated the total amount of absolute heterogeneity ($σ^2$; the total variation not explained by sampling error), its sources or relative heterogeneity ($I^2$), mean-standardised metric (CVH2) and variance-mean-standardised metric of heterogeneity (M2) following the pluralistic approach suggested by @yang2024a .\n\nTo test the relative importance of the two main adaptive hypotheses suggested for GNM, that is, the courtship and the parental care hypothesis, which combines the nest protection and drug hypotheses, we ran a multilevel meta-regression including the moderator ‘hypothesis’ (levels: courtship, parental care, both). For this and all meta-regressions, we estimated $R_{marginal}^2$,which corresponds to the percentage of heterogeneity explained by the moderators [@nakagawa2012]. Unless stated otherwise, all meta-regressions correspond to unimoderator meta-regressions.\n\n### Exploratory meta-regressions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nparasite_pathogen<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%filter(trait_type==\"Parasitic_and_pathogenic\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe performed additional pre-registered multilevel meta-regressions for which we did not have clear or strong directional predictions. To understand the effect of type of experimental design (i.e., whether the authors compared non-aromatic vs. aromatic, no added material vs. aromatic, no added material vs. non-aromatic), we ran a meta-regression with the type of experimental design as the moderator. To test the effect of time of addition of GNM on fitness (levels: before egg hatching, after egg hatching, continuously throughout the nesting phase), we ran a meta-regression with time of addition of GNM as the moderator. We also ran a meta-regression using bird species as the moderator (levels: Buteo buteo, Cyanistes caeruleus, Passer cinnamomeus, Parus major, Sturnus unicolor, Sturnus vulgaris, Tachycineta bicolor) to understand if and how the effect of GNM on fitness might differ among species. Furthermore, we explored the effect of GNM on fitness depending on the type of trait (i.e., fitness proxy) studied (levels: behaviour, morphology, parasite and pathogenic load, phenology, physiology, reproduction) using a meta-regression with the trait type as the moderator. Last, for the subset focusing on parasites and pathogens (k = 90, n = 16)), we ran a meta-regression with the type of parasite as the moderator (levels: arthropod, micro-organism).\n\nIn addition, we performed X additional multilevel meta-regressions intended to explore the potential threats to the internal validity of each study on our conclusions (i.e., Risk of Bias or RoB) following recommendations in Culina et al. (2025). …\n\n### Publication Bias Test\n\nPublication bias occurs when a subset of research findings, most often statistically non-significant ones, are less likely to be published or published later [@Jennisons2013].  There are two types of publication biases found to be commonplace in ecology and evolutionary biology: small-study and decline effects [@yang2023]. We tested them for both lnRR and SMD(H) separately, following @nakagawa2022a. To test for small-study effects, we ran a multilevel meta-regression using the inverse of the effective sample size as the moderator. To test for decline effects (also known as time-lag bias; @sanchez-tojar2018), we ran a multilevel meta-regression using year of publication (mean-centered) as the moderator.\n\n# Results\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nES_per_study<-dataset_analysis%>%group_by(paper_ID)%>%count(paper_ID)\n\nbirds_info<-dataset_analysis%>%group_by(bird_species)%>%count(bird_species)\nbirds_info$perc<-(birds_info$n/nrow(dataset_analysis))*100\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe obtained 274 effect sizes from a total of 28 studies conducted on 7 species across 17 geographical locations (@figmain-distribution).

Our dataset included 2 unpublished studies (k = 18), with the remaining studies being published between 1988 and 2024.

For lnRR, all three heterogeneity metrics exceeded the 75th percentile benchmark (see [@supp-tab-heterogeneity] for detailed estimates of heterogeneity).\n\nThese overall results, and their conclusions were robust to several sensitivity analyses. First, we fitted a pre-registered bivariate multilevel meta-analytic model including both effect sizes as response variables (lnRR = \\-0\\.015, p-value = 0\\.624 and SMD(H) = 0\\.250 , p-value = 0\\.069). In addition, we ran several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the overall results to: (i) the inclusion of traits for which their relationship with fitness was unclear (non-pre-registered), (ii) the removal effect sizes that were originally reported as simply statistically non-significant (non-pre-registered), (iii) both (i) and (ii) (non-pre-registered), and, (iv) the removal of effect sizes that were calculated by transforming inferential statistics. The number of effect sizes included in those sensitivity analyses ranged from 182 to 274 effect sizes, and the conclusions remained largely the same [@tabsupp-SA-intercept].\n\n![**Overall effect of green nest material on all fitness proxies combined.** The meta-analytic mean (large circle) with 95% confidence intervals (thicker bars) and prediction intervals (thinner bars) are shown along with the data points (coloured circles) scaled by precision (inverse of standard error).

The latter suggests that, despite not being considered in the hypotheses, non-aromatic GNM could also play some role; however, the comparison between no added material and non-aromatic GNM, was negative and, although based on only 3 studies, statistically significantly so for lnRR (lnRR~no-material-vs-non-aromatic~ = \\-0\\.349, 95% CI: \\[\\-0\\.504\\, \\-0\\.195\\], 95% PI: \\[\\-0\\.708\\, 0\\.009\\], p-value <0\\.001, k = 10, n = 3;[@tabmain-MLMR]).  All levels but one differed statistically significantly (${p-value}_{lnRR}$ \\< 0.004 and ${p-value}_{SMD(H)}$ \\< 0.001 in all cases, except  ${SMD(H)}_{no-material-vs-aromatic}$ vs. ${SMD(H)}_{no-material-vs-non-aromatic}$ p-value = 0.140), and the moderator experimental design explained a large proportion of heterogeneity, indicating its great importance ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= 27.8% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= 24.4%).\n\nSecond, the overall positive effect of GNM on fitness outcomes tended to be larger when GNM was added continuously throughout the nesting phase ([@figmain-design-time]C,D). The overall effect was positive and statistically significant so for SMD(H) when material was continuously and experimentally added to the nest (lnRR~continously~ = 0\\.034, 95% CI: \\[\\-0\\.014\\, 0\\.083\\], 95% PI: \\[\\-0\\.270\\, 0\\.338\\], p-value = 0\\.165, k = 95, n = 12 and SMD(H)~continously~ = 0\\.302, 95% CI: \\[ 0\\.069\\, 0\\.534\\], 95% PI: \\[\\-0\\.726\\, 1\\.329\\], p-value = 0\\.011, k = 105, n = 12), whereas the effect was small and statistically non-significant when added before egg hatching [@tabmain-MLMR]. Last, the overall effect also tended to be positive for SMD(H) when GNM was added after egg hatching only, although only marginally so (SMD(H)~after_egg_hatching~ = 0\\.267, 95% CI: \\[\\-0\\.024\\, 0\\.559\\], 95% PI: \\[\\-0\\.775\\, 1\\.310\\], p-value = 0\\.072, k = 57, n = 5; [@tabmain-MLMR]). The three categories did not differ statistically significantly from each other (p-value~lnRR~ \\> 0.307 and p-value~SMD(H)~ \\> 0.243 in all cases).

Fourth, most fitness trait-specific mean estimates were positive, but only morphology was statistically significant and reproduction marginally so, both only for SMD(H) (SMDH~morphology~ = 0\\.310, 95% CI: \\[ 0\\.112\\, 0\\.509\\], 95% PI: \\[\\-0\\.723\\, 1\\.343\\], p-value = 0\\.002, k = 65, n = 15; SMDH~reproduction~ = 0\\.153, 95% CI: \\[\\-0\\.034\\, 0\\.340\\], 95% PI: \\[\\-0\\.878\\, 1\\.184\\], p-value = 0\\.109, k = 63, n = 19) and trait type accounted for small amount of the heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= 3.7% and $R^2_{marginal(SMDH)}$= 2.4%). Last, for the subset of outcomes relating to pathogen and parasitic load, estimates for arthropods and micro-organisms did not differed statistically signficantly (\\@figsupp-MR; @tabmain-MLMR) and the type of parasite or pathogen explained very little heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= 0.4% and $R^2_{marginal(SMDH)}$= 1.6%).\n\n## **Publication Bias**\n\n# Discussion\n\nOur pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis provides the first quantitative synthesis of experimental studies on green nest material (GNM) across birds and reveals that, on average, supplementing nests with GNM yields only small benefits. The strength of the overall effects of GNM differed between the effect size metric used. Using the lnRR we found a non-significant 1.6% increase in overall fitness proxies, whereas the SMD(H) indicated a small but statistically significant positive effect (SMD(H)= 0.179). These differences in overall effect size magnitude likely reflect the underlying biological and statistical assumptions - lnRR incorporates the mean difference at a multiplicative scale whereas SMDH expresses the difference on an additive scale. There was moderate to high heterogeneity among the effect sizes, which we tried to understand using several biological and methodological moderators. The difference in relative heterogeneity (I^2^) between the two effect sizes aligns with broader trends observed in meta-analysis in ecology and evolution [@yang2024].\n\nContrary to long-standing verbal models, neither the courtship hypothesis (visual/olfactory signalling) nor the parental-care hypothesis (parasite repellency or pharmacological \"drug\" effects) emerged as a consistent driver of these small gains. Effect estimates associated with courtship traits were positive but non-significant, and those associated with nestling protection were essentially zero. In other words, current evidence does not allow us to attribute the weak average benefit of GNM to a single prevailing mechanism. This result mirrors the idiosyncratic outcomes scattered through the primary literature and indicates that future tests will need to measure multiple pathways simultaneously---ideally pairing behavioural observations with direct assays of ectoparasites, microbial load, and nest-air volatiles.\n\nImportantly, our results reveal that the commonly studied mechanistic hypotheses of GNM --whether through sexual signalling, parasite reduction, or direct nestling benefits-- lack consistent empirical support across studies.\n\nSecond paragraph\n\n-   Difference between the hypothesis, whether you can do it or not\n\n-   Experimental design difference.. importance of aromatic vs. Non-aromatic (are the same that aroma per say) and time of addition \n\n    Third paragraph :\n\nHow much heterogeneity is explained.. \n\nLimitations and issues about the data.. mechanism, publication bias.. species are few tested, few labs.. \n\nProxies that are closer.. \n\nIf study ID is \n\nTemp Discussion:\n\n**Discussion**\n\n[manuscript_GNM]{.underline}. The discrepancy between metrics underscores how the inferred magnitude of benefit depends on the underlying scale: lnRR captures proportional shifts, whereas SMDᴴ reflects absolute shifts that are sensitive to among-study variance. Nonetheless, both converge on the same biological interpretation---if GNM is adaptive, the advantage appears subtle rather than dramatic, and it is expressed against a backdrop of substantial heterogeneity (I² ≈ 66--99 %).\n\nMethodological context explained far more of the variance than biological hypothesis. Designs that compared nests with **no added material** versus **aromatic material** produced the largest positive effects (lnRR ≈ 0.15; SMDᴴ ≈ 0.84), whereas contrasts between **no material** and **non-aromatic plant matter** were negative, and the canonical **aromatic vs. non-aromatic** comparison was indistinguishable from zero. These patterns emphasise that simply adding any material can alter micro-climate, and that the perceived \"aromatic benefit\" may in part reflect removing a structural disadvantage in controls rather than an odour-specific mechanism. In addition, time of addition mattered: experiments that replenished GNM continuously throughout nesting detected stronger benefits (significant under SMDᴴ) than those adding it only before or after hatching, hinting that persistence of volatile release or parental display may be important [manuscript_GNM]{.underline}.\n\nDespite these insights, most of the heterogeneity remains unexplained. Experimental design alone accounted for roughly a third of total variance, whereas parasite type, trait category, timing, and species identity each explained ≤ 8 % [manuscript_GNM]{.underline}. The residual scatter likely stems from taxonomic and geographic bias---82 % of effect sizes come from just three passerines (blue tit, spotless starling, European starling) studied at 16 sites, many of them by the same research groups. Publication-bias diagnostics were equivocal, yet small-study effects cannot be excluded given the prevalence of datasets with ≤ 5 nests per group and the tendency to publish novel positive outcomes. Together these limitations caution against broad generalisation and point to the need for coordinated multi-lab efforts on under-represented taxa (e.g., open-cup builders, raptors).\n\nSeveral practical recommendations follow. First, future experiments should adopt fully factorial designs that separate **structure** (any plant vs. none) from **chemistry** (aromatic vs. non-aromatic) and track volatilome dynamics across the nesting cycle. Second, fitness proxies should move beyond morphology---currently the only trait category with a significant positive response---to harder endpoints such as fledging success, juvenile recruitment, and parental survival. Third, sharing raw data and negative results will be essential to reduce residual heterogeneity and clarify whether the modest average benefit we detect is biologically meaningful or a statistical artefact of design choices.\n\nIn summary, our review shows that adding green plant material to bird nests can increase fitness‐related measures, but the effect is small, context-dependent, and not yet pinned to a single mechanism. By refining experimental designs, broadening taxonomic coverage, and integrating chemical ecology with behavioural ecology, the next generation of studies can resolve whether GNM is truly an adaptive extended phenotype or merely a conspicuous but weak contributor to avian reproductive success.\n\nNicely looking colours!!!! Alright, alright. In short, ask me more if it is not clear. When you ran these 2 meta-regressions specifically, you normally would run them twice, once without the intercept from which you obtain the values you are presenting (i.e., the real lnRR and SMD(H) estimates specific for each off the three levels: Parental Care, Courtship, and Both), and then you would run them with the intercept. In the latter, the intercept, unless you changed the order of the levels in the moderator (which is a factor), would represent \"Both\", and the output would not tell you the difference between the estimate of level \"Courtship\" and \"Both\", and \"Parental Care\" and \"Both\" (i.e., the estimate is a difference, e.g. lnRRboth = 0.025 - lnRRcourtship = 0.038 = -0.13) and whether that difference is statistically significant. We want to show whether any differences between the levels are statistically significant, so we should present these p-values to say whether each of the pair-wise comparisons differs statistically or not. For you to know if \"Courtship\" and \"Parental Care\", you need to run an extra line of code, because from the model you only get the information about the difference between all levels of the factor (in this case, \"Courtship\" and \"Parental Care\") and the reference level AKA intercept (in this case \"Both\"). \\\n\\\nYou can use:\\\ncar::linearHypothesis(model, rbind(c(0,1,-1)))\\\n\\\nFor more: [https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:testing_factors_lincoms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:testing_factors_lincoms&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1751963317237496&usg=AOvVaw3NHnLsaKPtM6xq0VTTbXZO)\n\nImportantly, if the moderator would be a continuous moderator, e.g. publication year, you do not need to do any extra test, but should present the estimates for the intercept in the model as well as the estimates for the slope. When the moderator is continuous, you do not remove the intercept (i.e., no -1). Let me know if something is unclear. Good job, looking forward to reading the manuscript.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Supplementary Appendix\n\n# PRISMA Checklist\n\nCheck with the online prisma list at <https://arc.net/l/quote/zhrgrlso>\n\nSome items might be missing in the list, confirm as you fill...\n\n::: {#tabsupp-checklist .table}\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| **Checklist item** | I**tem score** | **Sub-item number** | **Sub-item** | **Reported by authors?** | **Notes** |\n| **Title and abstract** | **100%** | 1.1 | Identify the review as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both | Yes | Identified in title and in abstract as both a systematic review and a meta-analysis |\n|  |  | 1.2 | Summarise the aims and scope of the review | Yes | In the abstract |\n| 1.3 | Describe the data set | Yes | In the abstract |  |  |\n| 1.4 | State the results of the primary outcome | Yes | In the abstract |  |  |\n|  |  | 1.5 | State conclusions | Yes | In the abstract |\n|  |  | 1.6 | State limitations | Yes | In the abstract |\n| **Aims and questions** | **100%** | 2.1 | Provide a rationale for the review | Yes | Rationale explained in the Introduction in detail |\n|  |  | 2.2 | Reference any previous reviews or meta-analyses on the topic | Yes | Clearly stated twice in the introduction |\n|  |  | 2.3 | State the aims and scope of the review (including its generality) | Yes | Scope (only birds and experimental studies) explained in the aims in the last paragraph of Introduction |\n|  |  | 2.4 | State the primary questions the review addresses (e.g. which moderators were tested) | Yes | Moderators tested are clearly stated in the last paragraph of the introduction and the methods in data analysis section. |\n|  |  | 2.5 | Describe whether effect sizes were derived from experimental and/or observational comparisons | Yes | Only experimental studies were selected, described in the last paragraph of introduction as well as the methods |\n| **Review registration** | **100%** | 3.1 | Register review aims, hypotheses (if applicable), and methods in a time-stamped and publicly accessible archive and provide a link to the registration in the methods section of the manuscript.
