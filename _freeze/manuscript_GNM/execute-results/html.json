I must:\n\n-   Summarise the aims and scope of the review\n\n-   Describe the data set\n\n-   State the results of the primary outcome\n\n-   State conclusions\n\n-   State limitations\n\n# Introduction\n\nNest and nest-building are fundamental across a diverse range of animals, including insects (e.g., termites, spiders), mammals (e.g., platypus, rodents), and perhaps more famously, birds. Nests provide structural support for eggs, parents, and offspring, and protect them against predators and environmental pressures, and are thus key to reproductive success and survival [@mainwaring2014; @deeming2023; @hansell2000]. While most birds use organic plant materials such as twigs, branches, grass, and moss, some incorporate inorganic items, including stones, feathers, snake skins and even anthropogenic materials like plastic and cigarette butts [@suárez-rodríguez2013; @sergio2011; @sheard2024]. These non-structural additions suggest that nests are more than just physical shelters; they can be complex tools shaped by both natural and sexual selection for multiple functions. Indeed, nests can play a key role in sexual display, and features such as size have been shown to act as sexually selected signals of parental quality in many bird species [@moreno1994; @hoi1996], even across species [@soler1995]. Nest-building behaviour is increasingly recognized as an expression of the extended phenotype (reviewed by @moreno2012), and phylogeny has been shown to be an important factor explaining both mean and within-species variation in nest morphology [@perez2023]. Yet, despite hundreds of scientific articles studying nests and nesting behaviour in birds being published each year, much remains unknown.\n\nAn intriguing nesting behaviour observed in some bird species is the addition of fresh, often aromatic, plant material to the nest. This green nest material (GNM) ---leaves, sprigs, herbs and branches--- is typically added from the start of nest building until egg laying, although some species keep adding it even after the nest is finished. Importantly, contrary to the structural nest materials (e.g., twigs, branches), GNM is thought to be selected from a small, non-random subset of local flora [@clark1985; @garrido-bautista2023], and often characterized by high levels of aromatic volatile compounds (commonly used by songbirds: @clark1985) or secondary metabolites such as oils and resins (commonly used by raptors: @ontiveros2007). Collecting and constantly replenishing GNM requires extra foraging flights, sometimes even outside the territory [@mennerat2009]. The costs associated with nest building [@mainwaring2013], and these additional efforts suggest that GNM is unlikely to be gathered opportunistically and suggests a possible adaptive significance.\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive function of GNM [@dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015]. First, the courtship hypothesis suggests that mostly males use GNM as visual or olfactory signals to attract females or advertise nest site occupancy, particularly in cavity-nesting species since visual cues inside the nest are limited. This hypothesis traces back to the early natural history observations by @kessel1957, who noted that male European Starlings (*Sturnus vulgaris*) carried fresh plant material to their nests while singing and displaying to females. Subsequent studies in both European and Spotless Starlings (*Sturnus unicolor*) supported this view that GNM may serve as a sexually selected signal of male quality by showing that (i) unpaired males conspicuously deliver GNM during courtship, stopping right after the onset of egg laying [@brouwer2004; @veiga2006], and seemingly increasing this behaviour in the presence of potential mates [@eens1993], and (ii) females often prefer nests with fresh GNM. The courtship hypothesis was later extended to explain GNM addition solely by females in species like Blue Tits (*Cyanistes caeruleus*), therefore suggesting that GNM might serve as a sexually selected signal of female quality [@tomás2013].\n\nSecond, and the most widely tested one, is the nest protection hypothesis, which proposes that the volatile compounds in GNM reduce the amount of parasites and pathogens in the nests, enhancing offspring survival. This hypothesis traces back to a comparative study in raptors (Falconiformes) that proposed it and provided indirect evidence for it by comparing the nest reuse, diet composition and GNM presence [@wimberger1984]. Soon after, a preference for GNM containing insect-repellent and antimicrobial volatiles was experimentally confirmed in European Starlings, therefore confirming two of the three key criteria for evaluating the nest protection hypothesis (i.e., selective plant use, bioactive chemical properties and demonstrable adaptive benefits; @clark1988). Observational and experimental studies on raptors [@ontiveros2007; @dykstra2009] and passerines [@dawson2004; @lafuma2001; @mennerat2009b; @quiroga2012] have shown mixed results, and in some cases, GNM has been shown to improve offspring condition without reducing the amount of parasites in the nests [@gwinner2000], which led to the development of the drug hypothesis. The drug hypothesis suggests that the volatiles present in GNM directly enhance offspring immune function and/or health independent of parasite or pathogen control [@gwinner2000; @mennerat2009a]. Thus, while both hypotheses suggest an adaptive benefit of GNM by enhancing offspring survival, the drug hypothesis emphasizes a pharmacological mechanism, whereas the nest protection hypothesis emphasizes parasite and pathogen repellency. Importantly, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive unless the improvement in offspring health can be proved to be unrelated to a reduction in parasite or pathogen load.\n\nLast, several additional adaptive hypotheses or functions of GNM that do not refer to its aromatic properties have been proposed. These include benefits such as enhancing the crypticity of the nest [@skutch1957], providing insulation or sun protection for eggs and offspring [@mertens1977], or simply fulfilling a structural function [@lyons1987]. However, these alternative functional roles have received little support or attention. In all, despite decades of research, abundant observational and experimental studies, and two crucial narrative reviews [@dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015], we still do not know the overall adaptive significance of GNM, its generality across bird species, and the relative importance of each of the suggested mechanisms. Given that nest building is widespread across taxa ---including but not limited to birds--- and is increasingly recognized as an expression of the extended phenotype, a quantitative synthesis of this field is both timely and potentially far-reaching in its implications.\n\nTo address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of experiments testing the effect of GNM on various fitness proxies across birds. Our meta-analysis explicitly evaluates the overall evidence for the adaptive significance of GNM, as well as assesses the relative importance of the main suggested hypotheses: the courtship hypothesis and parental care hypothesis (i.e. combining both the nest protection and drug hypotheses due to their non-exclusivity). In addition, we explore the observed context-dependency (i.e., high heterogeneity among effect sizes) via meta-regressions. Specifically, we tested whether the effect of GNM varied depending on the type of parasite (arthropods vs. microorganisms), the timing of GNM addition (before hatching, after hatching, or continuously), the experimental design (aromatic vs. non-aromatic vs. no added material), the focal species, and the type of fitness proxy investigated (e.g., physiology, morphology, reproduction). Our meta-analysis of experimental studies is the first quantitative synthesis testing the causal relationship between GNM and fitness across birds.\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ndevtools::install_github(\"daniel1noble/orchaRd\", ref = \"main\", force = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nDownloading GitHub repo daniel1noble/orchaRd@main\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npillar (1.10.2 -> 1.11.0) [CRAN]\nRcpp   (1.0.14 -> 1.1.0 ) [CRAN]\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nInstalling 2 packages: pillar, Rcpp\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\t/var/folders/sp/jlskm_817d78dg8nvdk72l0c0000gn/T//RtmpD7qypa/downloaded_packages\n── R CMD build ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n* checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/sp/jlskm_817d78dg8nvdk72l0c0000gn/T/RtmpD7qypa/remotes9e307ebbf4b5/daniel1noble-orchaRd-20d9a75/DESCRIPTION’ ...

Science Core Collection and Scopus on 07.09.2022 (see update below). The keyword search query was designed as a three-block query to include terms related to our treatment of interest ((\"green\\*\" OR \"herb\\*\" OR \"aromatic\\*\") AND \"nest\\*\"), population of interest (\"bird\\*\" OR \"aves\" OR \"avian\" OR \"ornithol\\*\" OR \"passerine\\*\" OR \"passeriform\\*\" OR \"songbird\\*\" OR list of all bird genera) and to limit the search results to experimental studies only (\"experiment\\*\" OR \"manipulat\\*\"). The complete search strings tailored to each specific platform are provided in @figsupp-string. We searched through titles, abstracts and keywords in English-language only with no restrictions on publication date or study type. We validated our search using an initial library of 15 relevant articles that we had previously identified (@figsupp-own-library), ensuring all were retrieved. Additionally, we used the R package 'litsearchr' v1.0.0 [@grames2019], which did not yield any new relevant terms, to confirm our keyword selection. After removing 152 duplicates using R package 'revtools' v0.4.1 [@westgate2019], we found 383 unique records.\n\n## Eligibility criteria\n\nAll titles and abstracts were equally allocated and screened independently by atleast two screeners (SD, TR, JMGS) using the R package `revtools` following a pre-designed decision tree with all inclusion/exclusion criteria (@figsupp-decision-tree). We included all studies on birds that experimentally manipulated the GNM (both aromatics or herbs). Forty articles passed the title-and-abstract screening and were further evaluated during the full-text screening, where each article was independently screened by a single screener (SD, TR, JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure. We used the same criteria as above (@figsupp-decision-tree) with an additional evaluation of whether the variable of interest in the article was in our list of fitness proxies of interest (see @figsupp-fitness-proxies). Twenty\\-two passed the full-text screening and were, thus, eligible for our meta-analysis. All conflicts in screening decisions (\\~1% disagreement for title-and-abstract screening, and none for full-text screening) were resolved through discussion.\n\nWe updated our systematic literature search by repeating our search on 12.08.2024. We found 53 unique articles after removing 13 duplicates. Only one observer (SD) performed the title-and-abstract and full-text screening using the same decision trees as before (@figsupp-decision-tree), and found 1 additional eligible article for our meta-analysis. Lastly, we identified 3 additional eligible articles through other sources (i.e., identified through a poster by a collaborator and through an independent recommendation by a colleague). In all, 26 articles were eligible for our meta-analysis (more details in @figsupp-prisma-flowchart).\n\n## Data Extraction\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nmerged_data_extraction <- read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/merged_data_extraction.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\ndataset_after_cleaning <- read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/dataset_after_cleaning.csv\", show_col_types = F)\nincluded_papers_no<-length(unique(dataset_after_cleaning$paper_ID))\n\n# Numbers for extraction ID\ndata_extractors <- merged_data_extraction %>%\n     distinct(paper_ID, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%\n     select(paper_ID, extractor_ID) %>%\n     mutate(extractor_ID = case_when(\n    extractor_ID == \"JS/SD/TR\" ~ \"TR/JMGS/SD\",\n    TRUE ~ extractor_ID)) %>%\n     group_by(extractor_ID) %>%\n     summarise(total_papers = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nexcluded_proxies<- merged_data_extraction %>%\n  filter(fulltext_screening == \"included\" |\n         is.na(fulltext_screening) |\n         fulltext_screening == \"NA\") %>%\n  filter(proxy_decision== \"exclude\")\n\ndataset_analysis <- read_csv(\"data/04_data_analysis/dataset_analysis.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\nSAonly_proxies<- dataset_analysis %>% filter(proxy_decision==\"sensitivity-analysis\")\n\ninferential_only<- dataset_analysis%>%filter(statistics_type==\"t-test\"|statistics_type==\"ANCOVA\")\n\ncontingency_table<-dataset_analysis%>%filter(proxy_decision==\"contingency table\")\n\nraw_data<-c(\"GNM_001_rep_table3\",\"GNM_010\",\"GNM_069\",\"GNM_237\") \n#GNM_018 also provides open data but we ended up not needing it\n\npublished_studies <- dataset_analysis %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(paper_ID, \"Unpublished\"))\n\nunpublished_studies <- dataset_analysis %>%\n  filter(str_detect(paper_ID, \"Unpublished\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data of each article was extracted evenly by one of the three authors (SD, TR, JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure. We prioritised extracting the primary data (i.e., measures of central tendency, variance and sample size) from text and tables, or, if that was not possible, from figures (e.g., boxplots) using the R package `metaDigitise` v.1.0.1 (@pick2018). If primary data were not available, we extracted inferential statistics such as *t* and *F* values (k = 4, n = 2) or descriptive statistics such as contingency tables (k = 4, n = 2), that could be transformed into an effect size. Last, if the previous steps failed but the article has openly shared datasets (n = 4), we calculated the means, SD and sample sizes from them. **When data was presented in different sources (e.g. in a boxplot and as an inferential statistics), we prioritized the source having the maximum resolution (the boxplot, in this example).**\n\nWe extracted the means, variances and sample size for each control-treatment pairwise comparison. Controls included non-aromatic materials such as grass or moss, lesser amounts of aromatic material, or no material at all. Treatments consisted of aromatic materials added by authors, birds, or both. For cases that compared non-aromatic material to where authors did not add any additional nest material and any material added by the birds was removed, the non-aromatic material was considered the treatment. We recorded the type of comparison being made as a moderator. For each study, we also extracted information related to the study subjects (species of birds, location of the study population), the methodology of the study (plant species used as treatment and control, fitness proxy measured) and the source from which we extracted data (e.g., figures, tables, raw data files, or supplementary materials). We categorised the fitness proxies measured into 6 broad categories - physiology, morphology, reproduction, behaviour, parasite and pathogenic load, and phenology. For studies testing whether GNM affects the number of parasites or pathogens found in offspring and/or nests, we categorised them into arthropods or microorganisms. For a complete list of variables extracted see @figsupp-variables . We did not include some traits in all our analyses because it was unclear how they related to fitness (k = 15 , n = 5; see @figsupp-excluded-proxies for the list and reasons of exclusion).\n\nTo obtain missing data (e.g., non-reported results, missing sample sizes, etc.), we contacted four authors. All four authors responded to our email, but only two provided the data as requested; one did not have the data any more, and one did not give a conclusive response. Additionally, to locate grey literature (i.e., unpublished data), we wrote to the corresponding author(s) of all the articles that passed full-text screening (n = 22) to ask for any potential unpublished data that could be included in our meta-analysis. One corresponding author provided data for an unpublished study (see description in @figsupp-unpublished-study) and one of the authors of this study (MO), provided data for another unpublished study. In all, we extracted data for 26 published articles and 2 unpublished studies. Author correspondance was performed using a standardised email template (@figsupp-email). In all, we extracted data for 26 published articles (k = 265) and 2 unpublished studies (k = 18).\n\n## Effect size calculation\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nno_ES<-dataset_analysis%>%filter(proxy_comment == \"use 0 as ES\")\n\nnegative_lnRR<-dataset_analysis%>%\n  filter(measure_central_tendency_experiment<=0 | measure_central_tendency_control<=0)\n\nlow_sample<-dataset_analysis%>%filter(is.na(SMDH_sign))\n\ndataset_lnRR <- read_csv(\"data/04_data_analysis/dataset_lnRR.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n\ndataset_SMDH <- read_csv(\"data/04_data_analysis/dataset_SMDH.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe calculated two effect sizes for each pairwise comparison: a log response ratio (lnRR) and a standardised mean difference with heteroskedasticity correction (SMDH), using the `escalc` function (`measure= ROM` and `SMDH` respectively, `vtype= \"LS\"`) in the R package `metafor` [@metafor]. We specified the treatment group as the numerator and the control group as the denominator for lnRR and treatment minus control for SMDH, such that positive values indicate the 'fitness' value increased in the treatment group. In cases such as measures of parasite load or prevalence, laying or hatching dates, courtship time, scab score etc., the effect size sign was inverted to ensure comparability across all fitness proxies. In all cases, the effect sizes were coded such that the fitness proxies were positively correlated with the overall fitness. SMDH could only be calculated when there were enough data points in both treatment and control groups to estimate the pooled variance— specifically, when the degrees of freedom (i.e., n1+n2−2) was greater than 1 (excluded k = 9, n = 1)\n\nFor inferential statistics (e.g., *t* value, *F* value), we estimated SMD values (k = 4, n = 2) using the equations provided by @thehand2019. For dichotomous variables (e.g., number of successful nests, k = 4, n = 2), we calculated the log odds ratio (lnOR) using the `escalc` function (`measure=OR`) from `metafor` and subsequently converted it to SMD using equations from @thehand2019. Since lnRR cannot be calculated from inferential statistics, or dichotomous variables, or for comparisons including zero or negative values (k = 7, n = 5), the number of effect sizes included in the lnRR (k = 268, n = 28) subset is smaller than that of SMDH (k = 274, n = 28).\n\nWhen calculating each effect size's associated sampling variance, we prioritised the number of nests in each group over the number of individuals as the sample size, whenever possible to reduce the effect of genetic relatedness non-independence. In cases where the control or treatment group was used repeatedly across multiple comparisons, sample sizes were adjusted by dividing them by the number of times each group was used in a comparison to account for shared group non-independence. For the cases where the authors of an original article reported no statistically significant difference between two groups but did not provide numerical values (k = 16, n = 2), we assigned zero as the effect size for that comparison and imputed its sampling variance using the missing-case approach described in @nakagawa2022 for lnRR and using $\\frac{n_1+n_2}{n_1×n_2}$ for SMD [@lajeunesse2013].\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nWe performed all analyses in R version 4.5.1 [@R-version]. All multilevel meta-analytical models and meta-regressions were fit using metafor v.4.8-0 [@metafor]. Sampling variances were modelled as variance-covariance matrices assuming a 0.5 correlation (*ρ*) between sampling variances from the same study [@noble2017] using the vcalc function from metafor. (See Supplementary Appendix @figsupp-correlation for sensitivity analyses using different values of *ρ*).\n\nWe considered the following levels of non-independence for our analyses: multiple effect sizes collected from (a) same study (Paper ID), (b) bird species (Species ID) and (c) geographical locations (population ID), (d) sub-populations within the same location (Experiment ID; e.g. birds studied at the same location for multiple years or birds studied at the same location separated by distance), (e) groups of individuals within a population (Group ID; eg. males and females in a population, first clutch and second clutch) were represented in our data several times, and (f) repeated measurement of the same trait within the same individuals (Repeated trait ID; e.g. chick mass on day 7, 14 and 21).\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we fitted the following random effects in all our models to account for non-independence: Paper ID, Group ID, Species ID, Population ID and an observation-level random effect (Observation ID). Our random effect structure deviated from our pre-registration since, initially we had pre-registered the inclusion of Experiment ID and repeated trait ID and not population ID. However, Experiment ID and Group ID were almost indistinguishable, so we decided to leave out the one with lesser resolution i.e. Experiment ID. Additionally, few effect sizes were measured repeatedly, making the Repeated trait ID almost identical to the observation-level random effect (Observation ID), so we excluded it (@figsupp-random-effect). Last, we decided to add Population ID, since we noticed that several studies were performed in the same geographical locations.\n\n### Meta-analytic models: biological predictions\n\nTo estimate the effect of GNM addition on fitness across birds, we used two effect sizes: lnRR and SMD(H). Thus, throughout, we fitted two separate sets of model for each effect size. First, we fitted multilevel intercept-only meta-analytical model to test the overall effect, its uncertainty and heterogeneity. We used the `rma.mv` function from the `metafor` package using the 'REML' method and a *t* distribution for calculating test statistics and confidence intervals for the fixed effects. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis including some traits for which the relationship with fitness is unclear or debated in the literature (e.g. sex ratio, testosterone levels, etc.), to test the robustness of our results (@figsupp-MLMA-excluded; k = 21 , n = 8; see @figsupp-SAonly-proxies). For all intercept-only models, we estimated the total amount of absolute heterogeneity ($𝜎^2$; the variation not explained by the sampling error), its sources (or relative heterogeneity; $I^2$), mean-standardised metric ($CVH2$) and variance-mean-standardised metric of heterogeneity ($M2$) following the pluralistic approach suggested by @yang2025.\n\n<!--# Check what is MLMA-excluded and figsupp-SAonly-proxies for figures and decide which one makes more sense to include/exclude?? -->\n\nTo test the relative importance of the two main hypotheses suggested for GNM: Courtship hypothesis and Parental care hypothesis (combining nest protection and drug hypothesis), we ran a multilevel meta-regression with 'hypothesis' (Courtship hypothesis, Parental care hypothesis, Both) as a moderator. For this and all meta-regressions, we estimated $R_{marginal}^2$, which corresponds to the percentage of heterogeneity explained by the moderators [@nakagawa2012].\n\n### Meta-analytic models: exploratory analyses\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nparasite_pathogen<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%filter(trait_type==\"Parasitic_and_pathogenic\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe performed additional pre-registered multi-level meta-regressions for which we did not have clear or strong directional predictions on specific subsets of data. To understand the effect of GNM on the parasite load depending on the type of parasites, we used effect sizes on parasites and pathogens (k = 90, n = 16). We ran a meta-regression with a type of parasite as a moderator (levels: arthropod, micro-organism). We also ran a meta-regression with the entire dataset set using bird species as a moderator (levels: *Buteo buteo*, *Cyanistes caeruleus*, *Passer cinnamomeus*, *Parus major*, *Sturnus unicolor*, *Sturnus vulgaris*, *Tachycineta bicolor*) to understand if the effect of GNM on fitness depended on the system being studied. To test the effect of time of addition of GNM on the fitness outcome (levels: before egg hatching, after egg hatching, continuously throughout the nesting phase), we ran a meta-regression with Time of addition of GNM as the moderator. We explored the effect of GNM on fitness depending on the type of trait studies (levels: physiology, morphology, reproduction, behaviour, parasite and pathogenic load, phenology) using a meta-regression with the trait type as a moderator. We explored the impact of methodological differences on the relationship between GNM and fitness. To understand the effect of type of experimental design (i.e. whether the authors compared - non-aromatic vs. aromatic, no added material vs. aromatic, no added material vs. non-aromatic), we ran a meta-regression with the type of experimental design as a moderator.\n\n### Publication Bias Test\n\nPublication bias occurs when a subset of research findings, most often statistically non-significant ones, are less likely to be published or being published as compared to the rest. We tested for evidence of publication bias, both small-study and decline effects following @nakagawa2021. Publication bias tests were performed for both lnRR and SMD(H) separately, and using the same random effect structure as reported above. To test for small-study effects, we ran a multilevel meta-regression, using the inverse of the effective sample size as a moderator. To test for decline effects (also known as time-lag bias; @sanchez-tojar2018), we ran multilevel meta-regression year of publication (mean-centered) as a moderator.\n\n# Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nES_per_study<-dataset_analysis%>%group_by(paper_ID)%>%count(paper_ID)\n\nbirds_info<-dataset_analysis%>%group_by(bird_species)%>%count(bird_species)\nbirds_info$perc<-(birds_info$n/nrow(dataset_analysis))*100\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe obtained 283 effect sizes from 28 studies conducted on 7 species across 16 geographical locations (@fig-distribution).

The strength of the overall effects of GNM differed between the effect size metric used. Using the lnRR we found a non-significant 1.6% increase in overall fitness proxies, whereas the SMD(H) indicated a small but statistically significant positive effect (SMD(H)= 0.179). These differences in overall effect size magnitude likely reflect the underlying biological and statistical assumptions - lnRR incorporates the mean difference at a multiplicative scale whereas SMDH expresses the difference on an additive scale. There was moderate to high heterogeneity among the effect sizes, which we tried to understand using several biological and methodological moderators. The difference in relative heterogeneity (I^2^) between the two effect sizes aligns with broader trends observed in meta-analysis in ecology and evolution [@yang2024].\n\nContrary to long-standing verbal models, neither the courtship hypothesis (visual/olfactory signalling) nor the parental-care hypothesis (parasite repellency or pharmacological “drug” effects) emerged as a consistent driver of these small gains. Effect estimates associated with courtship traits were positive but non-significant, and those associated with nestling protection were essentially zero. In other words, current evidence does not allow us to attribute the weak average benefit of GNM to a single prevailing mechanism. This result mirrors the idiosyncratic outcomes scattered through the primary literature and indicates that future tests will need to measure multiple pathways simultaneously—ideally pairing behavioural observations with direct assays of ectoparasites, microbial load, and nest-air volatiles.\n\nImportantly, our results reveal that the commonly studied mechanistic hypotheses of GNM --whether through sexual signalling, parasite reduction, or direct nestling benefits-- lack consistent empirical support across studies.\n\nSecond paragraph\n\n-   Difference between the hypothesis, whether you can do it or not\n\n-   Experimental design difference.. importance of aromatic vs. Non-aromatic (are the same that aroma per say) and time of addition \n\n    Third paragraph :\n\nHow much heterogeneity is explained.. \n\nLimitations and issues about the data.. mechanism, publication bias.. species are few tested, few labs.. \n\nProxies that are closer.. \n\nIf study ID is \n\nTemp Discussion:\n\n**Discussion**\n\n[manuscript_GNM]{.underline}. The discrepancy between metrics underscores how the inferred magnitude of benefit depends on the underlying scale: lnRR captures proportional shifts, whereas SMDᴴ reflects absolute shifts that are sensitive to among-study variance. Nonetheless, both converge on the same biological interpretation—if GNM is adaptive, the advantage appears subtle rather than dramatic, and it is expressed against a backdrop of substantial heterogeneity (I² ≈ 66–99 %).\n\nMethodological context explained far more of the variance than biological hypothesis. Designs that compared nests with **no added material** versus **aromatic material** produced the largest positive effects (lnRR ≈ 0.15; SMDᴴ ≈ 0.84), whereas contrasts between **no material** and **non-aromatic plant matter** were negative, and the canonical **aromatic vs. non-aromatic** comparison was indistinguishable from zero. These patterns emphasise that simply adding any material can alter micro-climate, and that the perceived “aromatic benefit” may in part reflect removing a structural disadvantage in controls rather than an odour-specific mechanism. In addition, time of addition mattered: experiments that replenished GNM continuously throughout nesting detected stronger benefits (significant under SMDᴴ) than those adding it only before or after hatching, hinting that persistence of volatile release or parental display may be important [manuscript_GNM]{.underline}.\n\nDespite these insights, most of the heterogeneity remains unexplained. Experimental design alone accounted for roughly a third of total variance, whereas parasite type, trait category, timing, and species identity each explained ≤ 8 % [manuscript_GNM]{.underline}. The residual scatter likely stems from taxonomic and geographic bias—82 % of effect sizes come from just three passerines (blue tit, spotless starling, European starling) studied at 16 sites, many of them by the same research groups. Publication-bias diagnostics were equivocal, yet small-study effects cannot be excluded given the prevalence of datasets with ≤ 5 nests per group and the tendency to publish novel positive outcomes. Together these limitations caution against broad generalisation and point to the need for coordinated multi-lab efforts on under-represented taxa (e.g., open-cup builders, raptors).\n\nSeveral practical recommendations follow. First, future experiments should adopt fully factorial designs that separate **structure** (any plant vs. none) from **chemistry** (aromatic vs. non-aromatic) and track volatilome dynamics across the nesting cycle. Second, fitness proxies should move beyond morphology—currently the only trait category with a significant positive response—to harder endpoints such as fledging success, juvenile recruitment, and parental survival. Third, sharing raw data and negative results will be essential to reduce residual heterogeneity and clarify whether the modest average benefit we detect is biologically meaningful or a statistical artefact of design choices.\n\nIn summary, our review shows that adding green plant material to bird nests can increase fitness‐related measures, but the effect is small, context-dependent, and not yet pinned to a single mechanism. By refining experimental designs, broadening taxonomic coverage, and integrating chemical ecology with behavioural ecology, the next generation of studies can resolve whether GNM is truly an adaptive extended phenotype or merely a conspicuous but weak contributor to avian reproductive success.\n\nNicely looking colours!!!! Alright, alright. In short, ask me more if it is not clear. When you ran these 2 meta-regressions specifically, you normally would run them twice, once without the intercept from which you obtain the values you are presenting (i.e., the real lnRR and SMD(H) estimates specific for each off the three levels: Parental Care, Courtship, and Both), and then you would run them with the intercept. In the latter, the intercept, unless you changed the order of the levels in the moderator (which is a factor), would represent \"Both\", and the output would not tell you the difference between the estimate of level \"Courtship\" and \"Both\", and \"Parental Care\" and \"Both\" (i.e., the estimate is a difference, e.g. lnRRboth = 0.025 - lnRRcourtship = 0.038 = -0.13) and whether that difference is statistically significant. We want to show whether any differences between the levels are statistically significant, so we should present these p-values to say whether each of the pair-wise comparisons differs statistically or not. For you to know if \"Courtship\" and \"Parental Care\", you need to run an extra line of code, because from the model you only get the information about the difference between all levels of the factor (in this case, \"Courtship\" and \"Parental Care\") and the reference level AKA intercept (in this case \"Both\"). \\\n\\\nYou can use:\\\ncar::linearHypothesis(model, rbind(c(0,1,-1)))\\\n\\\nFor more: [https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:testing_factors_lincoms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:testing_factors_lincoms&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1751963317237496&usg=AOvVaw3NHnLsaKPtM6xq0VTTbXZO)\n\nImportantly, if the moderator would be a continuous moderator, e.g. publication year, you do not need to do any extra test, but should present the estimates for the intercept in the model as well as the estimates for the slope. When the moderator is continuous, you do not remove the intercept (i.e., no -1). Let me know if something is unclear. Good job, looking forward to reading the manuscript.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Supplementary Appendix\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code
