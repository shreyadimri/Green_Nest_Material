Nest building behaviour is increasingly recognized as an expression of extended phenotype, demonstrating interspecific and intraspecific trait variation [@moreno2012; @perez2023]. While most birds use organic plant materials- twigs, branches, grass, and moss- some incorporate inorganic items such as stones, feathers, snake skin and even anthropogenic materials [@sheard2024]. These non-structural additions suggest that nests are more than just physical shelters; they can be complex tools shaped by both natural and sexual selection for multiple functions.\n\nAn intriguing nesting behaviour observed in some birds is the use of fresh green plant material (green nest material or GNM). This includes leaves, sprigs, herbs and branches added during or even after primary nest construction has completed. Importantly, these green nest materials differ from the structural components, being selected from a small, non-random subset of local flora [@clark1985; @garrido-bautista2023], often characterized by high levels of aromatic volatile compounds (commonly used by Passerines, [@mennerat2009]) and secondary metabolites such as oils and resins (preferred by raptors, [@ontiveros2007]). The costs associated with gathering these materials beyond the territory and maintaining fresh greenery through the breeding season imply adaptive significance of the GNM.\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive function of green nest material (GNM). The courtship hypothesis suggests that males use aromatic plants as olfactory signals to attract mates or advertise nest site occupancy, particularly in cavity-nesting species where visual cues are limited. This idea traces back to the early natural history observations, beginning with @kessel1957, who noted that male European Starlings (*Sturnus vulgaris*) carried fresh plant material to nests while singing and displaying to females. Subsequent studies in European and Spotless Starlings (*Sturnus unicolor*) support this view: unpaired males conspicuously deliver greenery during courtship but stop after egg-laying begins [@brouwer2004; @veiga2006], and they increase this behaviour in the presence of potential mates \\[[@eens1993]\\]. Females often prefer nests with fresh herbs, suggesting that GNM may serve as a sexually selected signal of male quality and potentially increase fitness benefits for females. The courtship hypothesis has been also extended to species like Blue Tits (*Cyanistes caeruleus*), where it has been proposed that GNM might serve as a signal from females to the males [@tomás2013]. However, in both starlings and blue tits, the link between plant-bringing material in males and the fitness benefits for females still remain unclear.\n\nAnother hypothesis to explain the adaptive benefit of GNM is the widely tested nest protection hypothesis (NPH), which proposes that volatile compounds in green material reduce parasite abundance or pathogen loads, indirectly enhancing offspring survival. In an influential early comparitive study in raptors (Falconiformes), @wimberger1984 found indirect evidence for the reduction of ectoparasites in the nests with green nest material. @clark1988 later provided experimental support in European Starlings, showing that preferred herbs contained insect-repellent and antimicrobial volatile. They also outlined key criteria for evaluation of the NPH, including selective plant use, bioactive chemical properties and demonstrable adaptive benefits. Field observation and experimental studies on raptors [@ontiveros2007; @dykstra2009] and passerines [@dawson2004; @lafuma2001; @mennerat2009b; @quiroga2012] have shown mixed results, and in some cases, GNM improved nestling condition without reducing parasite abundance [@gwinner2000]. These findings led to the development of drug hypothesis, which suggests that the aromatic GNM directly enhance nestling development or immune function, independent of the parasite control [@gwinner2000; @mennerat2009a]. Thus, while both hypotheses posit adaptive benefits of GNM, the drug hypothesis emphasizes a pharmacological mechanism, and the two are not mutually exclusive. Several other adaptive functions of GNM have also been proposed. These functions do not refer to the aromatic properties of GM, but could still provide some benefits such as enhance the crypticity of the nest [@skutch1957], provide insulation for eggs and nestling [@mertens1977], provide protection from sun, signal nest occupancy or simply fill the gaps between nesting materials [@lyons1987]. These alternative functional roles have received little support or attention.\n\nDespite several observational and experimental studies and two crucial narrative reviews [@dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015], a comprehensive quantitative synthesis across studies and hypotheses has been lacking. This has limited our understanding of the generality and magnitude of GNM effects on fitness benefits. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the overall effect of GNM on various fitness proxies. We explicitly evaluate the evidence for the courtship and parental-care- the latter combining the nest protection and drug hypotheses due to their non-exclusivity. The drug hypothesis can only be supported by improved nestling health while ensuring that GNM has no protective effect against any parasite or pathogen.\n\nIn addition to testing these primary hypotheses, we further explore the context-dependency in the research field and examine the potential sources of variation in the results (heterogeneity) in the GNM effects. Specifically, we explored whether the effect of GNM varied depending on the type of parasite (arthropods vs. microorganisms), the timing of GNM addition (e.g., before hatching, after hatching, or continuously), the experimental design (e.g., aromatic vs. non-aromatic vs. no added material), the focal species, and the type of fitness trait measured (e.g., physiology, morphology, reproduction). These exploratory moderators could allow us to assess context dependence and identify ecological or methodological patterns that may explain inconsistencies in previous findings. Together, our evidence synthesis approach provides the first quantitative test of the adaptive value of green nest material across bird species and research contexts.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ndevtools::install_github(\"daniel1noble/orchaRd\", ref = \"main\", force = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nDownloading GitHub repo daniel1noble/orchaRd@main\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n── R CMD build ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n* checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/61/lmczt3d923df8ywy3mn788qm0000gn/T/Rtmp3Sfygv/remotes7c88164cd236/daniel1noble-orchaRd-4a44fdb/DESCRIPTION’ ...

The pre-registration details our objectives, a priori hypotheses and predictions, methods and planned data analyses. Unless stated otherwise, we adhered to the registered protocol. We followed the PRISMA-EcoEvo guidelines [@odea2021] for reporting this study (@figsupp-checklist). All resources associated with this study, including data and code, are available at \\[<https://github.com/shreyadimri/Green_Nest_Material>\\] (insert Zenodo citation later).\n\n## Information source and search\n\nWe conducted a systematic search on Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus on 07.09.2022. The keyword search query was designed as a three-block query to included terms related to the predictor/treatment ((\"green\\*\" OR \"herb\\*\" OR \"aromatic\\*\") AND \"nest\\*\"), our population of interest (\"bird\\*\" OR \"aves\" OR \"avian\" OR \"ornithol\\*\" OR \"passerine\\*\" OR \"passeriform\\*\" OR \"songbird\\*\" OR list of all bird genera) and to limit it to only experimental studies only (\"experiment\\*\" OR \"manipulat\\*\"). The complete search strings tailored to each specific platform are provided in @figsupp-string. We searched through titles, abstracts and keywords in English-language only with no restrictions on publication date or study type. We validated our search using an initial library of 15 relevant articles that we had previously identified (@figsupp-own-library), ensuring all were retrieved. Additionally, we used the R package 'litsearchr' v1.0.0 (@grames2019) to confirm our keyword selection, which did not yield any new relevant terms. We found 383 unique articles after removing 152 duplicates using R package 'revtools' v0.4.1 (@westgate2019).\n\n## Eligibility criteria\n\nAll titles and abstracts were equally allocated and screened independently by atleast two screeners (SD, TR, JMGS) using the R package `revtools` following a pre-designed decision tree (@figsupp-decision-tree). We included all studies on birds that experimentally manipulated the green nest material (both aromatics or herbs). 40 articles passed the title-and-abstract screening and were further evaluated during the full-text screening. Each article was screened by a single screener (SD, TR, JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure. We used the same criteria as above (see @figsupp-decision-tree) with an additional evaluation of whether the variable of interest in the article was in our list of fitness proxies of interest (see @figsupp-fitness-proxies). 19 articles were excluded. All conflicts in screening decisions (\\~1% disagreement for title-and-abstract screening, and none for full-text screening) were resolved through discussion.\n\nTo update our systematic lietrature search, we repeated our search on 12.08.2024. This updated search found 53 unique articles after removing ``` {r} nrow(full_reference_before_deduplication_repeat)-``nrow(unique_reference_list_repeat) ``` duplicates. Only one observer (SD) performed the title-and-abstract and full-text screening using the same decision trees as before and found 1 additional eligible article. Lastly, we identified 3 additional eligible articles. In all, X <!--# Fill the no. of articles that are included --> articles were eligible for our meta-analysis (more details in @figsupp-prisma-flowchart).\n\n## Data Extraction\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nmerged_data_extraction <- read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/merged_data_extraction.csv\", show_col_types = F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nNew names:\n• `` -> `...1`\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ndataset_after_cleaning <- merged_data_extraction %>% filter(fulltext_screening!=\"excluded\")\nincluded_papers_no<-length(unique(dataset_after_cleaning$paper_ID))\n\n# Numbers for extraction ID\ndata_extractors <- merged_data_extraction %>%\n     distinct(paper_ID, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%\n     select(paper_ID, extractor_ID) %>%\n     mutate(extractor_ID = case_when(\n    extractor_ID == \"JS/SD/TR\" ~ \"TR/JMGS/SD\",\n    TRUE ~ extractor_ID)) %>%\n     group_by(extractor_ID) %>%\n     summarise(total_papers = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nexcluded_proxies<- dataset_after_cleaning %>% filter(proxy_decision==\"exclude\")\nSAonly_proxies<- dataset_after_cleaning %>% filter(proxy_decision==\"senstivity-analysis\" | proxy_decision==\"sensitivity-analysis\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe data of each article was extracted evenly by one of the three authors (SD, TR, JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure. We extracted the primary data (i.e., measures of central tendency, variance and sample size) from text whenever possible. In cases where primary data was only available in figures (e.g., boxplots), we used `metaDigitise` v.1.0.1 (@pick2018). If primary data was not available, we extracted any inferential statistics (t value, F value) that could be transformed into an effect size. In cases where the values could not be extracted from the article but datasets were provided, we calculated the means, SD and sample sizes from the provided raw data. When data was presented in different sources (e.g. in a boxplot and as an inferential statistics), we prioritized the source having the maximum resolution (the boxplot, in this example).\n\nWe extracted the means, variances and sample size for each control-treatment pairwise comparison. Controls included non-aromatic materials such as grass or moss, lesser amounts of aromatic material, or no material at all. Treatments consisted of aromatic materials added by authors, birds, or both. In cases comparing non-aromatic material to a blank nest, the non-aromatic material was considered the treatment. We recorded the type of comparison being made as a moderator.\n\nFor each study we also extracted information related to the study subjects (species of birds, location of the study population), the methodology of the study (plant species used as treatment and control, fitness proxy measured) and information about the extracted data (location or source of the data recorded). We categorized the fitness proxy measured into 6 broad categories - physiology, morphology, reproduction, behaviour, parasite and pathogenic load and phenology. For parasites or pathogens, we categorised them into arthropods or micro-organisms. For a complete list of variables extracted see @figsupp-variables . We did not include some traits in all our analyses becaause it was unclear how they related to fitness (k=10 , n=3;see @figsupp-excluded-proxies for the list and reason of exclusion). We also had to exclude some effect sizes (n=?, k=?) because of the low sample size per group (less than x).\n\nTo obtain missing data (e.g., non-reported results, missing sample sizes, etc.) and to locate grey literature (i.e. unpublished data), we wrote to the corresponding author of the articles that passed full-text screening using a standardized email template (\\@figsupp-email). We contacted four authors for missing data, while all corresponding authors were asked for any potential unpublished data that could be included in our meta-analysis. All four authors responded to our email but only two could provide the data as requested; one did not have the data any more and one did not give a conclusive response. In addition, one author provided data for an unpublished study (see description in @figsupp-unpublished-study) and one of the authors of this study (MO) provided data for an unpublished study. In all, we extracted data for 24 published articles and 2 unpublished studies.\n\n## Effect size calculation\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ninferential_stats<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%filter(statistics_type==\"t-test\"|statistics_type==\"ANCOVA\")\n\ncontingency_table<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%filter(proxy_decision==\"contingency table\")\n\nno_ES<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%filter(proxy_comment == \"use 0 as ES\")\n\nnegative_lnRR<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%\n  filter(measure_central_tendency_experiment<=0 | measure_central_tendency_control<=0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe calculated two effect sizes for each pairwise comparison: a log response ratio (lnRR) and a standardised mean difference with heteroskedasticity correction (SMDH), using the `escalc` function (`measure= ROM` and `SMDH` respectively, `vtype= \"LS\"`) in the R package `metafor` (@metafor). We specified the treatment group as the numerator and the control group as the denominator for lnRR and treatment minus control for SMDH, such that positive values indicate the 'fitness' value increased in the treatment group. In cases such as measures of parasite load or prevalence, laying or hatching dates, courtship time, scab score etc., the effect size sign was inverted to ensure comparability across all fitness proxies. In all cases, the effect sizes were coded such that the fitness proxies were positively correlated with the overall fitness.\n\nFor inferential statistics (e.g., *t* value, *F* value), we estimated SMD values (k=4, n=2) using the equations provided by @thehand2019. For dichotomous variables (e.g., number of successful nests, k= 3, n= 1), we calculated the log odds ratio (lnOR) using the `escalc` function (`measure=OR`) from `metafor` and subsequently converted it to SMD using equations from @thehand2019. Since lnRR cannot be calculated from inferential statistics, or dichotomous variables, or for comparisons including zero or negative values (k=8, n=5), the number of effect sizes included in the lnRR (k=?, n=?) subset is smaller than that of SMDH (k=?,n=?).\n\nWhen calculating each effect size's associated sampling variance, we prioritised the number of nests in each group over the number of individuals as the sample size, whenever possible to reduce the effect of genetic relatedness non-independence. In cases where the control or treatment group was used repeatedly across multiple comparisons, sample sizes were adjusted by dividing them by the number of times each group was used in a comparison to account for shared group non-independence. For the cases where the authors of an original article reported no statistically significant difference between two groups but did not provide numerical values (k=16, n=2), we assigned zero as the effect size for that comparision and imputed its SD using the missing-case approach described in @nakagawa2022.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nWe performed all analyses in R version 4.3.0 (@positteam2023). All multilevel meta-analytical models and meta-regressions were fit using `metafor v.4.8-0` (@metafor). Sampling variances were modelled as variance-covariance matrices assuming a 0.5 correlation (*ρ*) between sampling variances from the same study [@noble2017] using the `vcalc` function from `metafor`. (See Supplementary Appendix @figsupp-correlation for sensitivity analyses using different values of *ρ*).\n\nWe considered the following levels of non-independence for our analyses: (a) multiple effect sizes collected from same study (Paper ID), (b) bird species (Species ID) and (c) geographical locations (population ID), (d) some sub-populations (Experiment ID; e.g. birds studied at the same location for multiple years or birds studied at the same location separated by distance) and (e) group of individuals (Group ID; eg. males and females in a population, first clutch and second clutch) were represented in our data several times, and (f) some traits were collected on the same group of animals repeatedly (Repeated trait ID; e.g. chick mass on day 7, 14 and 21).\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we fitted the following random effects in all our models to account for non-independence: Paper ID, Group ID, Species ID, Population ID and an observation-level random effect (Observation ID). Our random effect structure deviated from our pre-registration since, initially we had pre-registered the inclusion of Experiment ID and repeated trait ID and not population ID. However, Experiment ID and Group ID were almost indistinguishable, so we decided to leave out the one with lesser resolution i.e. Experiment ID. Additionally, few effect sizes were measured repeatedly, making the Repeated trait ID almost identical to the observation-level random effect (Observation ID), so we excluded it (@figsupp-random-effect). Last, we decided to add Population ID, since we noticed that several studies were performed in the same geographical locations.\n\n### Meta-analytic models: biological predictions\n\nTo estimate the effect of green nest material addition on fitness across birds, we used two effect sizes: lnRR and SMDH. Thus, throughout, we fitted two separate sets of model for each effect size. First, we fitted multilevel intercept-only meta-analytical model to test the overall effect, its uncertainty and heterogeneity. We used the `rma.mv` function from the `metafor` package using the 'REML' method and a *t* distribution for calculating test statistics and confidence intervals for the fixed effects. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis including some traits for which the relationship with fitness was unclear, to test the robustness of our results (@figsupp-MLMA-excluded; k=21 , n=8; see @figsupp-SAonly_proxies). For all intercept-only models, we estimated the total amount of absolute heterogeneity ($𝜎^2$; the variation not explained by the sampling error), its sources (or relative heterogeneity; $I^2$), mean-standardised metric ($CVH2$) and variance-mean-standardised metric of heterogeneity ($M2$) following the pluralistic approach suggested by @yang2025.\n\n<!--# You have to correct the numbers for contingency table. It does not include the one data point from unpublished results -->\n\n<!--# Check what is MLMA-excluded and figsupp-SAonly-proxies for figures and decide which one makes more sense to include/exclude?? -->\n\nTo test the relative importance of the two main hypotheses suggested for green nest material: Courtship hypothesis and Parental care hypothesis (combining nest protection and drug hypothesis), we ran a multilevel meta-regression with 'hypothesis' (Courtship hypothesis, Parental care hypothesis, Both) as a moderator. For this and all meta-regressions, we estimated $R_{marginal}^2$, which corresponds to the percentage of heterogeneity explained by the moderators (@nakagawa2012).\n\n### Meta-analytic models: exploratory analyses\n\nWe performed additional pre-registered multi-level meta-regressions for which we did not have clear or strong directional predictions on specific subsets of data. To understand the effect of green nest material on the parasite load depending on the type of parasites, we used effect sizes on parasites and pathogens (n=?, k=?). We ran a meta-regression with a type of parasite as a moderator (levels: arthropod, micro-organism). We also ran a meta-regression with with the entire dataset set using bird species as a moderator (levels: Cyanistes caeruleus, Sturnus unicolor, Tachycineta bicolor, Sturnus vulgaris, Parus major, Passer cinnamomeus, Buteo buteo) to understand if the effect of green nest material on fitness depended on the system being studied. To test the effect of time of addition of green nest material on the fitness outcome (levels: before egg hatching, after egg hatching, continuously throughout the nesting phase) we ran a meta-regression with Time of addition of green nest material as the moderator. We explored the effect of green nest material on fitness depending on the type of trait studies (levels:physiology, morphology, reproduction, behaviour, parasite and pathogenic load, phenology) using a meta-regression with the trait type as a moderator. We explored the impact of methodological differences on the relationship between green nest material and fitness. To understand the effect of type of experimental design (i.e. whether the authors compared - non-aromatic vs. aromatic, no added material vs. aromatic, no added material vs. non-aromatic), we ran a meta-regression with the type of experimental design as a moderator.\n\n### Publication Bias Test\n\nPublication bias occurs when a subset of research findings, most often statistically non-significant ones, are less likely to be published or being published as compared to the rest. We tested for evidence of publication bias, both small-study and decline effects following @nakagawa2021. Publication bias tests were performed for both lnRR and SMDH separately, and using the same random effect structure as reported above. To test for small-study effects, we ran a multilevel meta-regression, using the inverse of the effective sample size as a moderator. To test for decline effects (also known as time-lag bias; @sanchez-tojar2018), we ran multilevel meta-regression year of publication (mean-centered) as a moderator.\n\n# Results\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ndataset_analysis <- read_csv(\"data/03_data_cleaning/dataset_analysis.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nRows: 279 Columns: 71\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (35): paper_ID, fulltext_screening, variable_note, authors, population_l...\ndbl (35): year_publication, Observation_ID, experiment_ID, group_ID, repeate...\nlgl  (1): fulltext_notes\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nES_per_study<-dataset_analysis%>%group_by(paper_ID)%>%count(paper_ID)\n\nbirds_info<-dataset_analysis%>%group_by(bird_species)%>%count(bird_species)\nbirds_info$perc<-(birds_info$n/nrow(dataset_analysis))*100\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe obtained 279 effect sizes from 28 studies conducted on 7 species across 19 geographical locations.

SMDH showed a larger effect with the There is high heterogeneity among the effect sizes, emphasizing the context-dependence of this benefit. Importantly, our results reveal that the commonly studied mechanistic hypotheses of green nest material---whether through sexual signaling, parasite reduction, or direct nestling benefits---lack consistent empirical support across studies.\n\nThe While lnRR and SMDH differ in their measurement scale, both effect sizes suggest a small positive but non-conclusive effect of green nest material on fitness. These differences in overall effect size magnitude likely reflect the underlying biological and statistical assumptions - lnRR incorporates the mean difference at a multiplicative scale whereas SMDH expresses the difference on an additive scale. The difference in relative heterogeneity (I^2^) between the two effect sizes aligns with broader trends observed in meta-analysis in ecology and evolution
