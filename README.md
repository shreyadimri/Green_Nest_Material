`Green_Nest_Material.Rproj` This is an R Project file for our project. We recommend using this .Rproj file after forking/downloading the repository to access the folders and scripts easily. It sets the working directory correctly and makes folder paths in R script more accessible.

`code/` This folder contains all the R scripts associated with this project, named in chronological order (eg. 00\_...,01\_..). The later stages of data cleaning and analysis are done using .Rmd files.

`data/` This folder contains all the data used or generated during this project. It is organized into sub-folders based on project steps:

-   `01_systematic_search/`
    -   `01_search_strategy` contains data related to developing of the search string for the systematic search.
    -   `02_reference_data` contains .bib files downloaded from the Web of Science and Scopus and the final unique_reference_list generated from combining and de-duplicating these files.
    -   `03_title_abstract_screening` contains data files with screening decisions, combined dataset after abstract screening and the selected dataset for subsequent steps.
-   `02_data_extraction/` This folder contains all the files associated with the data extraction for meta-analysis. It contains the different sets for data extraction for the three screeners. It also contains the final extracted data and the combined cleaned dataset for further steps.
-   `03_data_cleaning/`
-   `04_data_analysis/`
-   `05_data_sensitivity_analysis/`
