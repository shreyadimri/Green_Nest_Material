#-------------------------- Installing required packages----------------------------------------
# Remotes package is required to allow you to install litsearchr package
# Since it is only available through Github and not CRAN
# Skip this part if you have already installed litsearchr 

pacman::p_load(remotes, tidyverse)
#to install litsearchr from Github
install_github("elizagrames/litsearchr", ref="main")

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Loading required packaged if they are already installed
pacman::p_load(litsearchr,igraph,ggplot2)

#---------------------------------- Naive search file import and deduplication---------------------------------------------
 
# Before using litsearchr to refine your search terms, we can perform a naive search on the topic on WOS
# The references generated from this naive search can then be used to refine the search terms using litsearchr
# In this case we used references that were present in our own library (through previous searches)

# We can import .bib, .ris or .txt files using 
# import_results function of litsearchr (which is from synthesizer package)
# The function can also be used in case the searches were performed in more the one data base...
# ...e.g.  =c("savedrecs.bib","scopus.bib"))


# In our case we use .bib file "own_library_references.bib" from our own set of references

                                         file = "own_library_references.bib")


#remove_duplicates function can be used to deduplicate the list based on titles 
# One can use different methods to deduplicate such as exact search or fuzzy search

# In our case, we do not need to deduplicate since we have a short list of references 
# of 15 papers that we have looked at manually already.. 
# However we perform deduplication to show as an example with exact title comparision..
deduplicated_naiveimport<- litsearchr::remove_duplicates(naiveimport, field= "title", method = "exact")

#----------------------------to extract/search for keywords for the naive search------------------------------------------

#extract_terms is used to extract the search string words from our data base
#here we look for search string words in the title, abstract and keywords of the paper
#we use the fakerake method which is the default method of litsearchr that is similar to rapid automatic keyword extraction
#min_freq is the minimum number of times these words much occur in each paper
#min_n sets the minimum phrase that search string can be.. 
#in our case it can be a single word at minimum and maximum a two phrase word
