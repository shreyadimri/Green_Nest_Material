# Introduction

Nest and nest-building are fundamental across a diverse range of animals, including arthropods (e.g., termites, spiders), mammals (e.g., platypus, rodents), and perhaps more famously, birds. Nests provide structural support for eggs, parents, and offspring, and protect them against predators and environmental pressures, and are thus key to reproductive success and survival [@hansell2000; @mainwaring2014; @deeming2023]. While most birds use organic plant materials such as twigs, branches, grass, and moss to build their nests, some incorporate inorganic items, including mud, stones, feathers, snake skins and even anthropogenic materials like plastic and cigarette butts [@sergio2011; @suárez-rodríguez2013; @jagiello2023; @sheard2024]. The latter are considered non-structural additions and suggest that nests are more than just physical shelters; they can be complex tools shaped by both natural and sexual selection for multiple functions. Indeed, nests can play a key role in sexual display, and features such as size have been shown to act as sexually selected signals of parental quality in several bird species [e.g., @moreno1994; @hoi1996], even interspecifically by brood parasites [@soler1995]. Nest-building behaviour is increasingly recognized as an expression of the extended phenotype (reviewed by @moreno2012), and phylogeny has been shown to be an important factor explaining both mean and within-species variation in nest morphology [@perez2023]. Yet, despite hundreds of scientific articles studying nests and nesting behaviour in birds being published each year, much remains unknown.

An intriguing nesting behaviour observed in some bird species is the addition of fresh, often aromatic, plant material to the nest. This green nest material (hereafter GNM), which often corresponds to leaves, sprigs, herbs and branches, is typically added from the start of nest building until egg laying, although some species like the blue tit (Cyanistes cyanus), keep adding it even after the nest is finished. Importantly, contrary to the structural nest materials (e.g., twigs, mud), GNM is selected from a small, non-random subset of local flora [@clark1985; @petit2002; @garrido-bautista2023], and often characterized by high levels of aromatic volatile compounds (commonly used by songbirds: @mennerat2009b) or secondary metabolites such as oils and resins (commonly used by raptors: @ontiveros2007). GNM is unlikely to be gathered opportunistically, and collecting these uncommon GNM, and replenishing it for sometimes over weeks, requires extra time and, in some cases, flying outside one's territory [@mennerat2009]. Thus, the general costs associated with nest-building [@mainwaring2013],  and the additional effort, time and energy devoted to add these non-structural materials suggest an important adaptive function of GNM.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive function of GNM (reviewed in @dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015). First, the courtship hypothesis suggests that (mostly) males use GNM as visual or olfactory signals to attract females and/or advertise nest site occupancy to other males (e.g., @eens1993; @gwinner1997; @brouwer2004), particularly in cavity-nesting species where visual cues inside the nest are limited. The courtship hypothesis traces back to the early natural history observations by @kessel1957, who noted that male European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) carried fresh plant material to their nests while singing and displaying to females. Subsequent studies in both European and Spotless Starlings (Sturnus unicolor) supported this view that GNM may serve as a sexually selected signal of male quality by showing that females often prefer nests with fresh GNM, and that unpaired males conspicuously deliver GNM during courtship, stopping right after the onset of egg laying [@brouwer2004; @veiga2006], and increasing this behaviour in the presence of potential mates [@eens1993]. The courtship hypothesis was later extended to explain GNM addition solely by females in Blue Tits, therefore suggesting that GNM might serve as a sexually selected signal of female quality [@tomás2013].

Second, the most widely tested hypothesis is the nest protection hypothesis, which proposes that the volatile compounds in GNM reduce the amount of parasites and pathogens in the nests, enhancing offspring survival. This hypothesis traces back to a comparative study in raptors (Falconiformes) that provided indirect evidence for it by comparing nest reuse, diet composition and GNM presence [@wimberger1984]. Soon after, a preference for GNM containing insect-repellent and antimicrobial volatiles was experimentally confirmed in European Starlings and suggested three key criteria for evaluating the nest protection hypothesis [i.e., selective plant use, bioactive chemical properties and demonstrable adaptive benefits; @clark1985]. Observational and experimental studies on raptors [@ontiveros2007; @dykstra2009] and passerines [@lafuma2001; @dawson2004; @mennerat2009b; @quiroga2012] have shown mixed results. In some cases, GNM was shown to improve offspring condition without reducing the amount of parasites in the nests [@gwinner2000], which led to the development of the drug hypothesis. This alternative hypothesis suggests that the volatiles present in GNM directly enhance offspring immune function and/or health independent of parasite or pathogen control [@gwinner2000; @mennerat2009a]. Thus, while both the nest protection and drug hypotheses suggest an adaptive benefit of GNM by enhancing offspring survival, the drug hypothesis emphasizes a pharmacological mechanism, whereas the nest protection hypothesis emphasizes parasite and pathogen repellency. Importantly, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive unless the improvement in offspring health can be proved to be unrelated to a reduction in parasite or pathogen load, something difficult to achieve.

Last, several additional adaptive hypotheses or functions of GNM that do not refer to its aromatic (i.e., volatiles and secondary metabolites) properties have also been proposed. These include benefits such as enhancing the crypticity of the nest [@skutch1957], providing insulation or sun protection for eggs and offspring [@mertens1977], or simply fulfilling a structural function [@lyons1987]. However, these alternative functional roles have received little support or attention. In all, despite decades of research, abundant observational and experimental studies, and two crucial narrative reviews [@dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015], we still do not know the overall adaptive significance of GNM, its generality across bird species, and the relative importance of each of the suggested mechanisms. Given that nest building is widespread across taxa ---including but not limited to birds--- and is increasingly recognized as an expression of the extended phenotype, a quantitative synthesis of this field is both timely and has potentially far-reaching implications.

To address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of experiments testing the effect of GNM on various fitness proxies across birds. Our meta-analysis explicitly evaluates the overall evidence for the adaptive significance of GNM, as well as assesses the relative importance of the main suggested hypotheses: the courtship hypothesis and parental care hypothesis (i.e., a combination of both the nest protection and drug hypotheses). In addition, we tested several potential moderators that might explain the observed context-dependency (i.e., high heterogeneity among effect sizes). Specifically, we tested whether the effect of GNM varied depending on the experimental design used (aromatic vs. non-aromatic vs. no added material), the timing of GNM addition (before hatching, after hatching, or continuously), the focal species studied, the type of fitness proxy investigated (e.g., physiology, morphology, reproduction), and the type of parasite (arthropods vs. microorganisms). Our meta-analysis of experimental studies is the first quantitative synthesis testing the causal relationship between GNM and fitness across birds.

# Methods

## Registration and reporting

We pre-registered our study protocol on the Open Science Framework [@dimri2024] prior to data exploration and analysis. The pre-registration details our objectives, a priori hypotheses and predictions, methods and planned data analyses. Unless stated otherwise, we adhered to the registered protocol. We followed the PRISMA-EcoEvo guidelines [@odea2021] for reporting this study (@tabsupp-checklist; @figsupp-prisma-flow). All resources associated with this study, including data and code, are available at \[<https://github.com/shreyadimri/Green_Nest_Material>\] (insert Zenodo citation later).

```

We conducted a systematic search on Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus on the 7th of September, 2022 (see update below). The keyword search query was designed as a three-block query including terms related to our treatment of interest (("green\*" OR "herb\*" OR "aromatic\*") AND "nest\*"), population of interest ("bird\*" OR "aves" OR "avian" OR "ornithol\*" OR "passerine\*" OR "passeriform\*" OR "songbird\*" OR list of all bird genera) and to limit the search results to experimental studies only ("experiment\*" OR "manipulat\*"). The complete search strings tailored to each specific platform are provided in @figsupp-string. Although our search string only included keywords in English, we planned to screen any study in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Hindi, but found none. We searched through titles, abstracts and keywords with no restrictions on publication date or study type. We validated our search using an initial library of 15 relevant articles that we had previously identified (@figsupp-own-library), ensuring all were retrieved. Additionally, we used the R package 'litsearchr' v1.0.0 [@grames2019], which did not yield any new relevant terms, confirming our queries. After removing `{r} nrow(full_reference_before_deduplication)-nrow(unique_reference_list)` duplicates using the R package 'revtools' v0.4.1 [@westgate2019], we identified `{r} nrow(unique_reference_list)` unique records.

## Eligibility criteria

All titles and abstracts were equally allocated and screened independently by at least two screeners (SD, TR, JMGS) using the R package 'revtools' following a pre-designed decision tree with all inclusion/exclusion criteria (@figsupp-decision-tree). We included all studies on birds that experimentally manipulated the GNM (both aromatics or herbs). `{r} tools::toTitleCase(as.character(english::english(nrow(selected_abstract_screening))))` articles passed the title-and-abstract screening and were further evaluated during the full-text screening, where each article was independently screened by a single screener (SD, TR, JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure. We used the same criteria as above (@figsupp-decision-tree) with an additional evaluation of whether the variable of interest in the article was in our list of fitness proxies of interest (@figsupp-fitness-proxies). `{r} paste0(toupper(substring(x <- as.character(english::english(nrow(selected_abstract_screening) - nrow(excluded_fulltext))), 1, 1)), substring(x, 2))` articles passed the full-text screening, and were, thus, eligible for our meta-analysis. All conflicts in screening decisions (1% for title-and-abstract screening, and none for full-text screening) were resolved through discussion.

We updated our systematic literature search by repeating our search on the 12th of August, 2024, and found `{r} nrow(unique_reference_list_repeat)` unique articles after removing `{r} nrow(full_reference_before_deduplication_repeat)-nrow(unique_reference_list_repeat)` duplicates. Only one observer (SD) performed both screenings using the same decision trees as before (@figsupp-decision-tree), and found `{r} as.character(english::english(sum(selected_abstract_screening_repeat$screened_abstracts=="selected", na.rm=T), 1, 1))` additional eligible article for our meta-analysis. Lastly, we identified `{r} as.character(english::english(nrow(selected_abstract_screening_repeat)-(sum(selected_abstract_screening_repeat$screened_abstracts=="selected", na.rm=T)), 1, 1))` additional eligible articles recommended by two colleagues. In all, `{r} nrow(selected_abstract_screening)-nrow(excluded_fulltext)+nrow(selected_abstract_screening_repeat)` published articles were eligible for our meta-analysis, but we also obtained two additional unpublished studies (more details below and in @figsupp-prisma-flowchart).

```

The data of each article were extracted evenly by one of three authors (SD, TR,  JMGS), with another screener verifying the procedure, and four authors (SD, TR, JMGS, AST) collectively discussing and revising unclear cases. We prioritised extracting primary data (i.e., measures of central tendency, variance and sample size) from text and tables, or, if that was not possible, from figures (e.g., boxplots) using the R package 'metaDigitise' v1.0.1 [@pick2018]. If primary data were not available, we extracted inferential statistics such as t and F values or contingency tables to transform them into effect sizes (see below). Last, if the previous steps failed but the article had openly archived data, we calculated the means, standard deviation and sample sizes from each group ourselves (n = `{r} length(raw_data)`).

We extracted the means, variances and sample sizes for each control-treatment pairwise comparison. Depending on the experimental design of each study, controls included non-aromatic materials such as grass or moss, lesser amounts of aromatic material than the treatments, no additional material added, or removal of material added by birds; whereas treatments consisted of aromatic materials added by authors, birds, or both. Those comparisons were coded either as non-aromatic GNM vs. aromatic GNM, or no added GNM vs. aromatic GNM, in our moderator "experimental design". However, there was a third type of comparison used in some studies comparing nests with experimentally added non-aromatic GNM to nests without any added GNM or in which GNM added by the birds was removed by the authors. In this type of comparison, the non-aromatic GNM was considered the treatment, and we coded these `{r} nrow(lnRR_comp3)` and `{r} nrow(SMDH_comp3)` effect sizes, respectively, as non-aromatic GNM vs. no added GNM in our moderator "experimental design". Importantly, our conclusions were robust to the exclusion of these effect sizes (\@Table SX), so we kept them in our dataset, and the moderator "experimental design" was used for subsequent meta-regressions. In studies where three groups were compared (n = `{r} nrow(multiple_comparision)`), we extracted all possible pairwise comparisons, and accounted for (shared-group) non-independence in our analyses (more below).

For each study, we also extracted information related to the study subjects (species of birds, geographical location of the study population), the methodology of the study (plant species used as treatment and control, fitness proxy measured) and the source from which we extracted data (e.g., figures, tables, raw data files, supplementary materials). We categorised the fitness proxies measured into 6 broad categories: physiology, morphology, reproduction, behaviour, parasite and pathogenic load, and phenology. For studies testing whether GNM affects the number of parasites or pathogens found in offspring and/or nests, we categorised them into arthropods or microorganisms. For a complete list of variables extracted, see @figsupp-variables . During data extraction, we encountered some traits (e.g., white-blood-cell ratio, parent mass; `{r} nrow(excluded_proxies)` effect sizes, n = `{r} length(unique(excluded_proxies$paper_ID))` studies) that we did not include in any of our analyses because it was unclear from the study and our own judgement how these traits related to fitness (see @figsupp-excluded-proxies for the list and reasons of exclusion).

To obtain missing data (e.g., non-reported results, missing sample sizes), we contacted four corresponding authors. All four authors responded to our email, but only two provided the data as requested; one did not have the data any more, and one did not give a conclusive response. Additionally, to locate grey literature (i.e., unpublished data), we wrote to the corresponding author(s) of all the (n = `{r} (nrow(selected_abstract_screening) - nrow(excluded_fulltext))` articles that passed full-text screening to ask for any potential unpublished data that could be included in our meta-analysis using a standardised email template (@figsupp-email). One author provided data for an unpublished study on Blue Tits (see description in @figsupp-unpublished-study) and one of us (MO) provided data for an unpublished study on Common Buzzards (*Buteo buteo*).

## Effect size calculation

```{r load effect size, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

no_ES<-dataset_analysis%>%filter(proxy_comment == "use 0 as ES")

negative_lnRR<-dataset_analysis%>%
  filter(measure_central_tendency_experiment<=0 | measure_central_tendency_control<=0)

low_sample<-read_csv("data/03_data_cleaning/low_sample.csv", show_col_types = F)

```

Using the means, standard deviations and sample sizes for each control-treatment pairwise comparison, we calculated two effect sizes: a log response ratio (lnRR) and a standardised mean difference with heteroskedasticity correction (SMDH), using the 'escalc' function (measure = ROM and SMDH, respectively, vtype = "LS") in the R package 'metafor' v4.8-0 [@metafor]. We specified the treatment group as the numerator and the control group as the denominator for lnRR, and treatment minus control for SMDH, such that positive values indicate a 'fitness' increase in the treatment group. In cases such as measures of parasite load or prevalence, laying or hatching dates, courtship time, or scab score, the effect size sign was inverted before analysis to ensure that a positive value consistently meant an increase in fitness regardless of fitness proxy (i.e., to ensure comparability across effect sizes). SMDH could only be calculated when there were enough data points in both treatment and control groups to estimate the pooled variance; specifically, when the degrees of freedom (i.e., n1+n2−2) was greater than 1. There were `{r} as.character(english::english(nrow(low_sample), 1, 1))` effect sizes from `{r} as.character(english::english(length(unique(low_sample$paper_ID)), 1, 1))`) study that did not fulfil that requirement, which we then excluded entirely from the dataset.

For the few cases for which we could not extract means and variances but inferential statistics such as t and F values, we estimated SMD values (k = `{r} nrow(inferential_only)`, n = `{r} length(unique(inferential_only$paper_ID))`) using the equations provided by @thehand2019. For dichotomous variables (e.g., number of successful nests, k = `{r} nrow(contingency_table)`, n = `{r} length(unique(contingency_table$paper_ID))`), we calculated the log odds ratio (lnOR) using the 'escalc' function (measure=OR) from 'metafor' and subsequently converted it to SMD using equations from @thehand2019. Since lnRR cannot be calculated from inferential statistics, dichotomous variables, or traits including zero or negative values (k = `{r} nrow(negative_lnRR)`), the number of effect sizes included in the lnRR (k = `{r} nrow(dataset_lnRR)`, n = `{r} length(unique(dataset_lnRR$paper_ID))`) subset is smaller than that of SMDH (k = `{r} nrow(dataset_SMDH)`, n = `{r} length(unique(dataset_SMDH$paper_ID))`).

When calculating each effect size's associated sampling variance, we prioritised the number of nests in each group over the number of individuals as the sample size whenever possible to reduce the effect of genetic relatedness non-independence. In cases where the same control or treatment group was used across multiple comparisons, sample sizes were adjusted prior to calculating effect sizes by dividing them by the number of times each group was used in a comparison to account for shared group non-independence. For cases where the authors of an original article reported a statistically non-significant difference between two groups but without providing numerical values (k = `{r} nrow(no_ES)`, n = `{r} length(unique(no_ES$paper_ID))`), we assigned zero as the effect size for that comparison and imputed its sampling variance using the missing-case approach described in @nakagawa2022 for lnRR and using $\frac{n_1+n_2}{n_1×n_2}$ for SMD [@lajeunesse2013].

## Data analysis

We performed all analyses in R v4.5.1 [@R-version]. All multilevel meta-analytical models and meta-regressions were fitted using 'metafor' v.4.8-0 [@metafor]. Sampling variances were modelled as variance-covariance matrices assuming a 0.5 correlation (ρ) between sampling variances from the same study [@noble2017] using the vcalc function from 'metafor' (See Supplementary Appendix @figsupp-correlation for sensitivity analyses using different values of *ρ*).

We originally considered the following levels of non-independence for our analyses: multiple effect sizes collected from  (a) same study (Paper ID), (b) bird species (Species ID) and (c) geographical locations (population ID), (d) sub-populations within the same location (Experiment ID; e.g., birds studied at the same location for multiple years), (e) groups of individuals within a population (Group ID; e.g., males and females in a population, first clutch and second clutch) were represented in our data several times, and (f) repeated measurement of the same trait within the same individuals (Repeated trait ID; e.g., chick mass on day 7, 14 and 21).

Unless stated otherwise, we fitted the following random effects in all our models to account for non-independence: Paper ID, Group ID, Species ID, Population ID and an observation-level random effect (Observation ID). Our random effect structure deviated from our pre-registration since, initially, we had pre-registered the inclusion of Experiment ID and Repeated trait ID but not Population ID. However, Experiment ID and Group ID were almost indistinguishable, so we decided to leave out the one with lesser resolution, i.e. Experiment ID. Additionally, few effect sizes were measured repeatedly, making Repeated trait ID almost identical to Observation ID (@figsupp-random-effect), so we excluded Repeated trait ID. Last, we decided to add Population ID since we noticed after extracting the data, but before any analyses, that several studies were performed in the same geographical locations.

### Meta-analytic mean and hypotheses

To estimate the effect of GNM on fitness across birds, we used two effect sizes: lnRR and SMD(H). Thus, throughout, we fitted two separate sets of model for each effect size. First, we fitted multilevel intercept-only meta-analytical model to test the overall effect, its uncertainty and heterogeneity. We used the `rma.mv` function from the 'metafor' package using the 'REML' method and a *t* distribution for calculating the test statistics and confidence intervals for the moderators. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis including some traits for which the relationship with fitness is debated in the literature (e.g., sex ratio, testosterone levels), to test the robustness of our results (@figsupp-MLMA-excluded; k = `{r} nrow(SAonly_proxies)` , n = `{r} length(unique(SAonly_proxies$paper_ID))`). For all intercept-only models, we estimated the total amount of absolute heterogeneity ($σ^2$; the total variation not explained by sampling error), its sources or relative heterogeneity ($I^2$), mean-standardised metric (CVH2) and variance-mean-standardised metric of heterogeneity (M2) following the pluralistic approach suggested by @yang2024a .

To test the relative importance of the two main adaptive hypotheses suggested for GNM, that is, the courtship and the parental care hypothesis, which combines the nest protection and drug hypotheses, we ran a multilevel meta-regression including the moderator 'hypothesis' (levels: courtship, parental care, both). For this and all meta-regressions, we estimated $R_{marginal}^2$, which corresponds to the percentage of heterogeneity explained by the moderators [@nakagawa2012]. Unless stated otherwise, all meta-regressions correspond to unimoderator meta-regressions.

### Exploratory meta-regressions

```{r}
parasite_pathogen<-dataset_after_cleaning%>%filter(trait_type=="Parasitic_and_pathogenic")
```

We performed additional pre-registered multilevel meta-regressions for which we did not have clear or strong directional predictions. To understand the effect of type of experimental design (i.e., whether the authors compared non-aromatic vs. aromatic, no added material vs. aromatic, no added material vs. non-aromatic), we ran a meta-regression with the type of experimental design as the moderator. To test the effect of time of addition of GNM on fitness (levels: before egg hatching, after egg hatching, continuously throughout the nesting phase), we ran a meta-regression with time of addition of GNM as the moderator. We also ran a meta-regression using bird species as the moderator (levels: Buteo buteo, Cyanistes caeruleus, Passer cinnamomeus, Parus major, Sturnus unicolor, Sturnus vulgaris, Tachycineta bicolor) to understand if and how the effect of GNM on fitness might differ among species. Furthermore, we explored the effect of GNM on fitness depending on the type of trait (i.e., fitness proxy) studied (levels: behaviour, morphology, parasite and pathogenic load, phenology, physiology, reproduction) using a meta-regression with the trait type as the moderator. Last, for the subset focusing on parasites and pathogens (k = `{r} nrow(parasite_pathogen)`, n = `{r} length(unique(parasite_pathogen$paper_ID))`)), we ran a meta-regression with the type of parasite as the moderator (levels: arthropod, micro-organism).

In addition, we performed three additional pre-registered multilevel meta-regressions intended to explore the potential threats to the internal validity of each study on our conclusions (i.e., Risk of Bias or RoB) following recommendations in @culina2025 . We evaluated the effects of (1) blinding (whether outcome assessors were blinded to the experimental group), (2) random assignment to treatment, and (3) partial reporting (whether all measured outcomes were completely reported or only a subset). For each RoB category, we coded studies (levels: yes, no) and included each category as a moderator in a meta-regression separately for both lnRR and SMD(H).

### Publication Bias Test

Publication bias occurs when a subset of research findings, most often statistically non-significant ones, are less likely to be published or published later [@Jennisons2013].  There are two types of publication biases found to be commonplace in ecology and evolutionary biology: small-study and decline effects [@yang2023]. We tested them for both lnRR and SMD(H) separately, following @nakagawa2022a. To test for small-study effects, we ran a multilevel meta-regression using the inverse of the effective sample size as the moderator. To test for decline effects (also known as time-lag bias; @sanchez-tojar2018), we ran a multilevel meta-regression using year of publication (mean-centered) as the moderator.

We obtained `{r} nrow(dataset_analysis)` effect sizes from a total of `{r} length(unique(dataset_analysis$paper_ID))` studies conducted on `{r} length(unique(dataset_analysis$bird_species))` species across `{r} length(unique(dataset_analysis$population_ID))` geographical locations (@figmain-distribution). About `{r} round(sum(birds_info$perc[birds_info$perc>15]))`% of the effect sizes came from three bird species (`{r} birds_info$bird_species[birds_info$perc > 15][1]`, k = `{r} birds_info$n[birds_info$perc > 15][1]`; `{r} birds_info$bird_species[birds_info$perc > 15][2]`, k = `{r} birds_info$n[birds_info$perc > 15][2]`; `{r} birds_info$bird_species[birds_info$perc > 15][3]`, k = `{r} birds_info$n[birds_info$perc > 15][3]`). Our dataset included `{r} length(unique(unpublished_studies$paper_ID))` unpublished studies (k = `{r} nrow(unpublished_studies)`), with the remaining studies being published between `{r} min((dataset_analysis$year_publication),na.rm = T)` and `{r} max((dataset_analysis$year_publication),na.rm = T)`.

## **Meta-analytic mean**

```

Both lnRR and SMD(H) intercept-only multilevel meta-analyses showed an average increase in fitness estimates in nests with an experimental increase in GNM compared to control nests; however, the overall effect was only statistically significant for SMD(H).

First, lnRR showed an average statistically non-significant increase in fitness outcomes of `{r} round((exp(as.double(coef(intercept_lnRR)))-1)*100,1)`% in nests with an experimental increase in GNM (@figmain-mean-effect A; lnRR = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(intercept_lnRR))`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", intercept_lnRR$ci.lb)` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f", intercept_lnRR$ci.ub)`\], 95% PI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", predict(intercept_lnRR)$pi.lb)` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f", predict(intercept_lnRR)$pi.ub)`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", intercept_lnRR$pval)`, k = `{r} intercept_lnRR$k`, n = `{r} length(intercept_lnRR$s.levels.f[[1]])`) but heterogeneity among effect sizes was high. Total raw heterogeneity (𝜎^2^) was `{r} sprintf("%.3f",sum(intercept_lnRR$sigma2))` (*Q* = `{r} sprintf("%.1f",sum(intercept_lnRR$QE))`, p \< 0.001), the measures of relative (*I^2^~total~* = `{r} sprintf("%.1f",orchaRd::i2_ml(intercept_lnRR)[1])`%) and standardised heterogeneity (CVH2~total~ = `{r} sprintf("%.2f", orchaRd::cvh2_ml(intercept_lnRR)[1])` and M2~total =~ `{r} sprintf("%.2f", orchaRd::m2_ml(intercept_lnRR)[1])`) suggested high heterogeneity across effect sizes.

Second, SMD(H) showed an average statistically significant increase in fitness outcomes in nests with an experimental increase of GNM (@figmain-mean-effect B; SMD(H) = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(intercept_SMDH))`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f",(intercept_SMDH)$ci.lb)` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f",(intercept_SMDH)$ci.ub)`\], 95% PI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", predict(intercept_SMDH)$pi.lb)` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f", predict(intercept_SMDH)$pi.ub)`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f",intercept_SMDH$pval)`, k = `{r} intercept_SMDH$k`, n = `{r} length(intercept_SMDH$s.levels.f[[1]])`), but heterogeneity among effect sizes was moderate to high. Total raw heterogeneity (𝜎^2^) was `{r} sprintf("%.3f",sum(intercept_SMDH$sigma2))` (*Q* = `{r} sprintf("%.1f",sum(intercept_SMDH$QE))`, p \< 0.001), relative heterogeneity was smaller compared to that of lnRR (*I^2^~total~* = `{r} sprintf("%.1f",orchaRd::i2_ml(intercept_SMDH)[1])`%) and the standardised heterogeneity metrics (CVH2~total~ = `{r} sprintf("%.2f", orchaRd::cvh2_ml(intercept_SMDH)[1])` and M2~total =~ `{r} sprintf("%.2f",orchaRd::m2_ml(intercept_SMDH)[1])`) lied between the 50th and 75th percentile of empirically derived estimates from meta-analyses in ecology and evolution [@yang2024a]. For lnRR, all three heterogeneity metrics exceeded the 75th percentile benchmark (see [@supp-tab-heterogeneity] for detailed estimates of heterogeneity).

These overall results, and their conclusions were robust to several sensitivity analyses. First, we fitted a pre-registered bivariate multilevel meta-analytic model including both effect sizes as response variables (lnRR = `{r} sprintf("%.3f",(coef(bivariate_model)[1]))`, p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f",(bivariate_model$pval[1]))` and SMD(H) = `{r} sprintf("%.3f",(coef(bivariate_model)[2]))` , p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f",(bivariate_model$pval[2]))`). In addition, we ran several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the overall results to: (i) the inclusion of traits for which their relationship with fitness was debated in the literature (non-pre-registered), (ii) the removal effect sizes that were originally reported as simply statistically non-significant (non-pre-registered), (iii) both (i) and (ii) (non-pre-registered), and, (iv) the removal of effect sizes that were calculated by transforming inferential statistics. The number of effect sizes included in those sensitivity analyses ranged from 182 to 274 effect sizes, and the conclusions remained largely the same [@tabsupp-SA-intercept].

## **Mechanistic Hypotheses**

Our multilevel meta-regressions found no clear support for the two main hypotheses proposed in the literature ([@figmain-hypothesis]). The estimates for the courtship hypothesis (lnRR~courtship~ = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$estimate[2]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$CI[2]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$PI[2]`, p-value = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$p_value[2]`, k = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$k[2]`, n = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$n[2]`; SMD(H)~courtship~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$estimate[2]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$CI[2]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$PI[2]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$p_value[2]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$k[2]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$n[2]`), and the nest protection and drug hypothesis (i.e., "parental care hypothesis") (lnRR~parental_care~ = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$estimate[3]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$CI[3]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$PI[3]`, p-value = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$p_value[3]`, k = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$k[3]`, n = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$n[3]`; SMD(H)~parental_care~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$estimate[3]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$CI[3]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$PI[3]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$p_value[3]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$k[3]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$n[3]`) were statistically non-significant. However, about half of all effect sizes could not be unequivocally assigned to only one hypothesis, so our meta-regression contained a third category that combined both. This category showed an average positive increase in fitness outcomes in nests with an experimental increase of GNM, but the effect was only statistically significant for SMD(H) (lnRR~both~ = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$estimate[1]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$CI[1]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$PI[1]`, p-value = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$p_value[1]`, k = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$k[1]`, n = `{r} summary_lnRR_hypothesis$n[1]`; SMD(H)~both~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$estimate[1]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$CI[1]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$PI[1]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$p_value[1]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$k[1]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_hypothesis$n[1]`). None of the three categories differed statistically significantly from each other (${p-value}_{lnRR)}$ \> 0.211 and ${p-value}_{SMD(H)}$ \> 0.178 in all cases), and the moderator explained very heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_hypothesis)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_hypothesis)*100,1))[1]`%).

Our intercept-only models above showed moderate to high levels of heterogeneity among effect sizes, which we tried to explain by performing several additional multilevel meta-regressions.

![**Experimental designs comparing nests with aromatic green nest material against nests without any green material, and those adding the material continuously, lead to the larger fitness effects.** Orchard plots of the multilevel meta-regressions showing the overall effect of green nest material depending on experimental design for (A: log response ratio (lnRR); B: standardized mean difference (SMD(H)), and time of green nest material addition (C: log response ratio (lnRR); D: standardized mean difference (SMD(H)). Mean estimates (large circles), 95% confidence intervals (thicker bars) and prediction intervals (thinner bars), are shown along the individual data points (transparently coloured circles) scaled by precision (inverse of standard error). k: number of effect sizes (number of studies is shown in the brackets). The x-axes are cropped to aid visualization (See Section [@figsupp-design-time] for complete figures).](figures/Figure_design_time_gnm_addition_cropped.png){#figmain-design-time}

First, the overall effect of GNM on fitness outcome differed largely depending on the experimental design used ([@figmain-design-time]A,B). The overall effect size for the comparison between no added material and aromatic GNM was positive and statistically significant (lnRR~no-material-vs-aromatic~ = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$estimate[2]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_lnRR_design$CI[2]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_lnRR_design$PI[2]`, p-value = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$p_value[2]`, k = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$k[2]`, n = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$n[2]` and SMD(H)~no-material-vs-aromatic~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_design$estimate[2]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_design$CI[2]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_design$PI[2]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_design$p_value[2]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_design$k[2]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_design$n[2]`\], whereas, the comparison between non-aromatic GNM and aromatic GNM was small and statistically non-significant ([@tabmain-MLMR]). The latter suggests that, despite not being considered in the hypotheses, non-aromatic GNM could also play some role; however, the comparison between no added material and non-aromatic GNM, was negative and, although based on only 3 studies, statistically significantly so for lnRR (lnRR~no-material-vs-non-aromatic~ = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$estimate[3]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_lnRR_design$CI[3]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_lnRR_design$PI[3]`, p-value `{r} summary_lnRR_design$p_value[3]`, k = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$k[3]`, n = `{r} summary_lnRR_design$n[3]`;[@tabmain-MLMR]).  All levels but one differed statistically significantly (${p-value}_{lnRR}$ \< 0.004 and ${p-value}_{SMD(H)}$ \< 0.001 in all cases, except  ${SMD(H)}_{no-material-vs-aromatic}$ vs. ${SMD(H)}_{no-material-vs-non-aromatic}$ p-value = 0.140), and the moderator experimental design explained a large proportion of heterogeneity, indicating its great importance ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_design)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_design)*100,1))[1]`%).

Second, the overall positive effect of GNM on fitness outcomes tended to be larger when GNM was added continuously throughout the nesting phase ([@figmain-design-time]C,D). The overall effect was positive and statistically significant so for SMD(H) when material was continuously and experimentally added to the nest (lnRR~continously~ =`{r} summary_lnRR_time_gnm_addition$estimate[3]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_lnRR_time_gnm_addition$CI[3]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_lnRR_time_gnm_addition$PI[3]`, p-value = `{r} summary_lnRR_time_gnm_addition$p_value[3]`, k = `{r} summary_lnRR_time_gnm_addition$k[3]`, n = `{r} summary_lnRR_time_gnm_addition$n[3]`; SMD(H)~continously~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$estimate[3]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$CI[3]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$PI[3]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$p_value[3]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$k[3]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$n[3]`), whereas the effect was small and statistically non-significant when added before egg hatching [@tabmain-MLMR]. Last, the overall effect also tended to be positive for SMD(H) when GNM was added after egg hatching only, although only marginally so (SMD(H)~after_egg_hatching~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$estimate[1]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$CI[1]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$PI[1]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$p_value[1]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$k[1]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_time_gnm_addition$n[1]`; [@tabmain-MLMR]). The three categories did not differ statistically significantly from each other (p-value~lnRR~ \> 0.307 and p-value~SMD(H)~ \> 0.243 in all cases). The timing of addition of GNM explained a small proportion of heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_time_gnm_addition)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_time_gnm_addition)*100,1))[1]`%).

![](tables/MLMR_table.png){#tabmain-MLMR}

Third, although none of the species-specific mean estimates were statistically significant, most were positive [[\@figsupp-MR](C-D); @tabmain-MLMR], and bird species identity explained a non-negligible amount of heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_birds)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMDH)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_birds)*100,1))[1]`%). Fourth, most fitness trait-specific mean estimates were positive, but only morphology was statistically significant only for SMD(H) (SMDH~morphology~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_trait$estimate[2]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_trait$CI[2]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_trait$PI[2]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_trait$p_value[2]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_trait$k[2]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_trait$n[2]`; @figsupp-MR; @tabmain-MLMR) and trait type accounted for small amount of the heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_trait)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_trait)*100,1))[1]`%). Fifth, for the subset of outcomes relating to pathogen and parasitic load, estimates for arthropods and micro-organisms did not differed statistically significantly (\@figsupp-MR; @tabmain-MLMR) and the type of parasite or pathogen explained very little heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_parasite)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_parasite)*100,1))[1]`%).

Lastly, the risk of bias categories we evaluated (i.e., blinding, random assignment to each treatment and partial reporting) were not statistically significant for lnRR ([@tabsupp-SA-RoB]). SMD(H) was positive and statistically significant for studies without blinding (SMD(H)~No Blinding~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_blinding$estimate[1]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_blinding$CI[1]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_blinding$PI[1]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_blinding$p_value[1]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_blinding$k[1]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_blinding$n[1]`; @tabsupp-SA-RoB), with random assignment to treatment (SMD(H)~Random Assignment~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_random_assignment$estimate[2]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_random_assignment$CI[2]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_random_assignment$PI[2]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_random_assignment$p_value[2]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_random_assignment$k[2]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_random_assignment$n[2]`; @tabsupp-SA-RoB) and where no data was missing (SMD(H)~No Partial Reporting~ = `{r} summary_SMDH_missing_data$estimate[1]`, 95% CI: `{r} summary_SMDH_missing_data$CI[1]`, 95% PI: `{r} summary_SMDH_missing_data$PI[1]`, p-value = `{r} summary_SMDH_missing_data$p_value[1]`, k = `{r} summary_SMDH_missing_data$k[1]`, n = `{r} summary_SMDH_missing_data$n[1]`; @tabsupp-SA-RoB). Notably, other levels of each category included fewer than four studies, indicating that the observed significance likely reflects the higher statistical power in the larger sample level rather than any systematic bias. All the three categories for risk of bias explained very little heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$\> `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_blinding)*100,1))[1]`%; $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$\> `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_random_assignment)*100,1))[1]`%).

There was no evidence for small-study effect for lnRR i.e. studies with smaller sample sizes did not have larger effect size estimates (lnRR~intercept~= `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(lnRR_small_study)[1])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_small_study$ci.lb[1])`, `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_small_study$ci.ub[1])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_small_study$pval[1])`, lnRR~slope~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(lnRR_small_study)[2])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_small_study$ci.lb[2])`; `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_small_study$ci.ub[2])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_small_study$pval[2])`, k = `{r} lnRR_small_study$k`, n = `{r} length(lnRR_small_study$s.levels.f[[1]])`, $R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_small_study)*100,1))[1]`%). There was a tendency for effect sizes to be larger when sample size was smaller but this relationship was not statistically significant (SMDH~slope~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(SMDH_small_study)[2])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_small_study$ci.lb[2])`, `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_small_study$ci.ub[2])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_small_study$pval[2])`, k = `{r} SMDH_small_study$k`, n = `{r} length(SMDH_small_study$s.levels.f[[1]])`, $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_small_study)*100,1))[1]`%). After adjusting for the funnelplot asymmetry (i.e., small study effect), the overall effect of GNM on fitness outcomes disappeared (SMDH~intercept~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(SMDH_small_study)[1])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_small_study$ci.lb[1])`, `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_small_study$ci.ub[1])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_small_study$pval[1])`).

Since published effect sizes did not seem to change considerably over time, our analyses suggest no clear evidence of decline effects (i.e., time-lag bias) in published effect sizes (lnRR~intercept~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(lnRR_decline_eff)[1])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_decline_eff$ci.lb[1])`; `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_decline_eff$ci.ub[1])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_decline_eff$pval[1])`, lnRR~slope~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(lnRR_decline_eff)[2])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_decline_eff$ci.lb[2])` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_decline_eff$ci.ub[2])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", lnRR_decline_eff$pval[2])`, k = `{r} lnRR_small_study$k`, n = `{r} length(lnRR_decline_eff$s.levels.f[[1]])`, $R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_decline_eff)*100,1))[1]`%; SMDH~intercept~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(SMDH_decline_eff)[1])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_decline_eff$ci.lb[1])` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_decline_eff$ci.ub[1])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_decline_eff$pval[1])`, SMDH~slope~ = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", coef(SMDH_decline_eff)[2])`, 95% CI: \[`{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_decline_eff$ci.lb[2])` to `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_decline_eff$ci.ub[2])`\], p-value = `{r} sprintf("%.3f", SMDH_decline_eff$pval[2])`, k = `{r} SMDH_decline_eff$k`, n = `{r} length(SMDH_decline_eff$s.levels.f[[1]])`, $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$ = `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_decline_eff)*100,1))[1]`%).

# Discussion

Our pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis provides the quantitative synthesis of adaptive function of green nest material (GNM) across birds through experimental evidence testing this relationship. We found that, on average, supplementing nests with GNM has a small positive effect on fitness proxies. Using two different effect size metrics, lnRR and SMD(H), and various sensitivity analyses, we found the direction of the effect to be consistent, which was statistically significant in the case of SMD(H). Sensitivity analyses, showed that the effect for both lnRR and SMD(H) slightly increased while the p-values decreased. There was moderate to high heterogeneity among effect sizes. We explored this heterogeneity through several biological and methodological moderators that we predicted could explain the differences in the fitness proxies, which accounted for some variation. However, a substantial portion of heterogeneity remains unexplained, highlighting the context-dependency of this effect as also suggested in the previous reviews on the topic [@dubiec2013; @scott-baumann2015].

The strength of the overall effects of GNM differed between the effect size metric used. The difference between the two effect size metrics (lnRR and SMD(H)) is likely due to the distinct assumptions regarding the underlying biological processes and the statistical properties. While lnRR reflects the multiplicative effect of the treatment, SMD(H) expresses the effect on an additive scale. These divergent results highlight the importance of choosing appropriate effect size metrics that align with the biological data at hand or in cases where several different types of measures are present, using both [@yang2024]. The difference in relative heterogeneity (I^2^) between the two effect sizes also aligns with broader trends observed in meta-analysis in ecology and evolution [@yang2024a].

We found no clear evidence supporting the long-standing mechanistic hypotheses explaining the adaptive function of GNM. The current evidence does not allow us to attribute the fitness benefit of GNM to a single mechanism. In the reviewed literature, only a few fitness proxies could be directly linked to courtship traits despite several studies looking into this mechanism. Traits such as courtship time, male provisioning, which are more closely linked to courtship hypothesis, showed no statistically significant effects. Contrary to our expectations, proxies associated with the parental-care hypothesis (i.e., nest protection and drug hypotheses combined), such as parasite loads, nestling health, had no adaptive benefits. Only proxies that could not be clearly assigned to either of the mechanistic hypotheses, such as survival rate, nestling morphological estimates, which we categorized as being associated with "both" the mechanisms, showed a positive effect of GNM addition. This ambiguity reflects the challenge of interpreting many fitness proxies in relation to underlying mechanisms, as they may be influenced by multiple overlapping processes.

Among the various predictors that we tested in our meta-regressions, methodological moderators accounted for substantially large part of the heterogeneity in effect sizes as compared to biological moderators. Our results highlight that the experimental design strongly influences the observed effect of GNM on fitness proxies. Experiments comparing nests with no added material and aromatic material showed larger positive effects. There was a `{r} round((exp(as.double(summary_lnRR_design$estimate[2]))-1)*100)`% increase in the fitness proxies in nests with GNM for experiments in this experimental design. The comparison between non-aromatic and aromatic GNM had a near zero effect. This suggests that simply adding non-aromatic materials, though often overlooked, can also contribute to fitness-related benefits through other alternative mechanisms. These benefits could include increasing the crypticity of a nest [@skutch1957], providing insulation to the eggs [@mertens1977], providing protection from sun or simply helping maintain the temperature and micro-climate of the nest. In other words, the aromatic property of GNM may not be the driving factor of the adaptive benefit. Experiments comparing no added material with non-aromatic GNM were negative. It is important to note that this particular comparison was highly underpowered to make meaningful conclusions.

Additionally, the continuous addition of GNM throughout the nesting period showed greater positive effects compared to addition limited to either before or after egg hatching. Previous work on Blue Tits has shown that the head-space concentration of active compounds in the aromatic plants can reduce within 24 hours [@petit2002], and females often replace removed herbs [@mennerat2008; @banbura1995]. This repeated addition has been suggested as a mechanism to maintain an aromatic environment to repel parasites or reduce their abundance. However, this larger adaptive benefit from continuous addition of GNM through the nesting phase can also be explained by the structural or micro-climate benefits of the GNM. Fresh GNM can act as a renewable lining that improves nest insulation and humidity buffering as the nesting material gradually desiccates [@mertens1977; @taverner1933]. Such micro-climate stability can accelerate nestling development while reducing thermoregulatory costs for the parents [@mainwaring2013]. Regular replenishment could also help replace the wilted material in the nest thus maintaining the structure of the nest and may have hygiene function by diluting faecal matter or food debris in the nest [@peralta-sanchez2010].

Among the various types of fitness proxies, morphological outcomes showed the largest positive effect in nests with GNM. Morphological traits such as nestling body mass, tarsus length, or wing length are often used as indicators of offspring body condition. All other trait types, including physiology, reproduction, phenology, and behaviour, showed small to moderate positive effects that were not statistically significant, whereas the proxies related to parasite or pathogen load showed weak inconsistent effects. Our results suggest that GNM may have more pronounced effects on development or growth-related traits but not on parasite defense. This result further emphasizes that there is no clear evidence supporting the nest protection hypothesis, despite its prominence in the literature. While the drug hypothesis has been proposed as an alternative explanation for enhanced offspring condition, several other mechanisms could also be at play. For example, improved morphological condition of the offspring could result from enhanced micro-climate of the nest, better incubation of the eggs or indirectly through sexually selected male traits, as suggested by courtship hypothesis. The diversity of fitness proxies and their varied biological interpretations makes it difficult to disentangle the precise pathways through which GNM impacts fitness.

We found that the overall effect of GNM on fitness proxies was highly heterogeneous and was mainly associated with within-study variation rather than among-study variation. This suggests that, once methodological and biological factors within studies are accounted for, the overall effect of GNM in our meta-analysis is consistent across studies as potentially generalisable. Among the biological moderators that we explored, species identity explained some of the observed heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_birds)*100,1))[1]`%; $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_birds)*100,1))[1]`%), indicating some species-specific effects. Trait-type also accounted for a small proportion of the heterogeneity ($R^2_{marginal(lnRR)}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(lnRR_trait)*100,1))[1]`% and $R^2_{marginal(SMD(H))}$= `{r} as.double(round(orchaRd::r2_ml(SMDH_trait)*100,1))[1]`%). The intrinsic differences in life-history traits, nest construction or habitat condition across bird species may influence how GNM affects fitness-related measures. All other biological moderators explained a negligible amount of heterogeneity. About one-fourth of the observed heterogeneity in effect sizes was explained by experimental design. This methodological moderator is an important factor in the study design in detecting the adaptive benefit of GNM.

We found high reporting quality in the primary study included in our meta-analysis, with only 0.06% partial reporting. There was no evidence for time-lag bias, suggesting that the results have not systematically declined over time. However, there was evidence of potential small-study effects suggesting slightly larger effects in smaller studies, but this relationship was only present in case of SMD(H) and lacked statistical support. However, after adjusting for this, the overall effect of GNM on fitness outcomes in SMD(H) was no longer significant, indicating that the observed benefit may be sensitive to publication bias assumptions and should be interpreted with caution. We found that a considerable number of primary studies had very low sample sizes.`{r} as.double(round((nrow(dataset_analysis%>%filter(n_experiment<10|n_control<10))/nrow(dataset_analysis))*100))[1]`% of the effect sizes were based on fewer than 10 nests per group.

Overall, our meta-analysis found a small positive effect of green nest material (GNM) on fitness estimates, the mechanisms and magnitude of these effects remain largely unclear and context-dependent. Future primary studies should focus on increasing sample sizes to improve statistical power. A substantial portion of effect sizes in this literature are derived from small, underpowered studies, which not only inflate heterogeneity but also contribute to uncertainty in effect estimates. Additionally, the selection of fitness proxies should be guided by their biological relevance and prioritizing proxies that clearly demonstrate survival or reproductive success, such as fledging rates, recruitment, etc., would provide a more robust foundation for future mechanistic investigations. Furthermore, studies remain heavily biased towards just three bird species, limiting our ability to infer broad patterns of this behaviour. Expanding the scope to other bird species with diverse nesting ecologies and habitat conditions can be useful in understanding the adaptive benefits of this behaviour.

### Systematic Search Information

Remember to make a text file to copy-paste more easily and put it in the repo maybe..

::: {#figsupp-string}
The search was conducted twice, the first time on 07.09.2022 and then repeated on 12.08.2024 to ensure it was the most up to date and did not miss any additional articles on the topic that were published meanwhile. For both the searches, we did not use any time limitation i.e. it included all the published literature till that given date. We used **Advance Search** option for both Web of Science Core Collection Database and Scopus Database using the search query given below.\
\
Search string for the Web of Science Core Collection\
Databases used in the search included\
-Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) \[1900-present\]\
-Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) \[1900-present\]\
-Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) \[1975 - present\]\
-Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) \[1991 - present\]\
-Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH) \[1991 - present\]\
-Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) \[2017- present\]\
\
We used advance search option and Title (TI), Abstract (AB) and Author Keywords (AK) to conduct our systematic search using the following string\
\

![Overall effect of green nest material on all fitness proxies combined: Mean meta-analytic estimate (large circle) with 95% confidence intervals (thicker bars) and prediction intervals (thinner bars) are shown along with the data points (transparent coloured circles) scaled by precision (inverse of standard error). Results are shown as an orchard plot for the intercept-only model (A) using log response ratio and (B) standardised mean difference as effect sizes. k: number of effect sizes (number of studies is shown in the brackets)](figures/Figure_overall_effect.png)
