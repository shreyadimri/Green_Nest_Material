In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants in blue tit nests affect physiological condition of nestlings as indicated by hemoglobin and glucose in the blood. Nestlings in nests supplemented with fresh, aromatic plants had elevated blood hemoglobin, and therefore improved physiological condition, as compared with control nestlings. There was no difference between nestlings in two contrasting habitats (urban parkland and forest). Although mean levels of blood glucose did not differ between treatment and control nestlings, the blood of forest nestlings contained more glucose than the blood of parkland nestlings, which indicates poorer health for forest nestlings. In general, knowledge of the effects of incorporating fresh green, aromatic plant material into avian nests on physiological condition of nestlings is still fragmentary and more experimental studies are needed. Significance statement: The blue tit is one of a few known passerine birds that incorporate fresh fragments of aromatic plants in their nest during the nesting period. Little is known about the impact of this material on nestling body condition, and there is a need to understand this behavior and its effects. We tested whether nestlings in nests supplemented with fresh, aromatic plants improved their physiological condition in comparison with control nestlings. The experiment showed that nestlings from supplemented nests improved their physiological condition by exhibiting elevated hemoglobin. Â© 2020, The Author(s).",1,2,selected,NA

Why some birds add green plants to their nests has long puzzled biologists. Some studies suggest that this behavior is promoted by natural selection because of its positive effects on nestling health. However, if greenery functions as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness, it may promote costly female competition for preferred males. We experimentally increased the amount of plants in spotless starling's nests, causing a reduction in the number of recruits. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses, adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and recruitment success.",16,2,selected,NA

In this field study on another cavity-nester, tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, we tested whether yarrow reduced ectoparasite loads (the nest protection hypothesis), stimulated nestling immune systems (the drug hypothesis), or had other consequences for nestling growth or parental reproductive success (predicted by both preceding hypotheses). Tree swallows do not naturally add greenery to their nests, and thus offer several advantages in testing for effects of greenery independent of other potentially confounding explanations for the behaviour. We placed fresh yarrow in 23 swallow nests on the day the first egg was laid, replenishing every two days until clutch completion (=three times), and at 44 control nests, nesting material was simply touched. At 12 days of age, we measured nestling body size and mass, and took blood smears to do differential white blood cell counts. We subsequently determined the number and proportion of young fledging from nests and the number of fleas remaining after fledging. Higher humidity was associated with higher flea numbers whereas number of feathers in the nest was not. Our most significant finding was that an average of 773 fleas Ceratophyllus idius was found in control nests, versus 419 in yarrow nests. Possibly, parents compensate for blood that nestlings lose to ectoparasites by increasing food delivery, because we detected no differences between treatments in nestling mass, nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion of young fledging, or relative to flea numbers. Our results provide no support for the drug hypothesis and strong support for the nest protection hypothesis. Â© Journal of Avian Biology.",137,2,selected,NA

Control males experienced a similar procedure, the only difference being that they were tested in the absence of a female. Female presence significantly affected both behavior and plasma T levels of male starlings. Experimental males spent significantly more time singing in the nest box and flew significantly more into the nest box with green nesting material during female presentations than during control periods. Control males never showed these mate attraction behaviors. In total 5 of the 16 experimental males did not respond behaviorally to the female stimulus bird (NR males). In contrast to T levels of control males, plasma T concentrations of both experimental males that did respond to the female (R males) and of NR males (which only perceived the female stimulus) were positively influenced by female presentation. The time spent singing in the nest box by experimental males (R and NR males combined) during female presence tended to be positively correlated with changes in plasma T levels. Finally, before introduction of a female, plasma T levels of R males were significantly higher than those of NR males indicating that individually housed males respond to the presence of a female conspecific by increasing their mate attraction behaviors only when a threshold plasma T concentration has been reached.

GNM_266,Gwinner2013353,Male European starlings use odorous herbs as nest material to attract females and benefit nestlings,"Gwinner, H.",Chemical Signals in Vertebrates 12,NA,NA,353-362,2013,10.1007/9781461459279,"Male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) use odorous herbs as green nest material. They show these plants to females to catch their attention before they incorporate them into their nests. Nestlings reared in nests containing herbs carry fewer bacteria, have higher haematocrit levels and more basophile leucocytes, and have a higher fledging weight than those reared in nests without herbs. The incubation temperature is higher in nests with herbs than in herbless nests. Females are attracted by herb nests and herb nests provide energy-saving benefits to incubating females. In choice experiments, starlings employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can only discriminate odours during the reproductive season. The association between odour perception and reproductive behaviour suggests that increased testosterone production, related to the increasing photoperiod in spring, may guide these seasonal changes. The size of the olfactory bulb but not its ability to discriminate was affected by testosterone implants in the non-reproductive season.

One of those, the Drug Hypothesis, states that aromatic plants present in nests have positive effects on nestlings' development through increased immune function. In this study, we aimed to examine if experimental addition of aromatic plants had positive effects on reproductive performance (the number of fledglings produced and nestling survival rate) and nestling development (weight and tarsus length). In addition, we study whether those potential effects were more noticeable in different brood sizes-small and large-through an observational approach. We expect that large broods, due to increased resource competition between nestlings, will benefit more from aromatic plant incorporation, as compared to small broods. Nestlings were significantly heavier in 2015 as compared to 2016 and 2017 and in small broods. No effect of treatment was observed in nestling weight. Although there was no overall effect of treatment on nestling tarsus length, nestlings from aromatic nests had significantly longer tarsi as compared to nestlings from control nests, in large broods.",2,2,selected,NA

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration.

GNM_152,X.WOS.000220540800019,Green nesting material has a function in mate attraction in the European starling,"Brouwer, L and Komdeur, J",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,67,3,539-548,2004,10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.07.005,"The function of fresh green nest material has long been debated. It has been suggested that it reduces the number of ectoparasites in nests and on nestlings (nest protection hypothesis), or is used by males to signal condition and paternal quality (male quality hypothesis) or is used as a sexually selected ornament to attract females (courtship hypothesis). We simultaneously tested these three hypotheses in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, in the field. Green material was carried by male starlings only, and mainly during nest building. It was not used to reduce ectoparasites. Males nesting in nestboxes that were experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more green nest material than males nesting in control boxes, and experimental removal and addition of green material had no effect on the number of ectoparasites on the nestlings or on their body mass. Furthermore, the amount of green material carried into a nestbox was not associated with male body mass, paternal incubation attendance or nestling food provisioning. There is two-fold experimental evidence that males use green plant material to attract mates. First, removal of greenery resulted in a significantly lower percentage of nestboxes containing a clutch than the control or addition treatment. Second, unpaired male starlings sang more and carried more greenery into a nestbox when a caged female was positioned adjacent to the nestbox than when a caged male or an empty cage was present. Paired males, when subjected to the same experimental design, did not respond. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

GNM_237,Ruiz.Castellano2016,Nest material shapes eggs bacterial environment,"Ruiz-Castellano, C. and TomÃƒÂ¡s, G. and Ruiz-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, M. and MartÃƒÂ­n-GÃƒÂ¡lvez, D. and Soler, J.J.",PLoS ONE,11,2,NA,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0148894,"Selective pressures imposed by pathogenic microorganisms to embryos have selected in hosts for a battery of antimicrobial lines of defenses that includes physical and chemical barriers. Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.

The males are polygynous and each attempts to attract unmated females by a special display to the nest he has woven of strips torn from leaves of palms or grasses. Females prefer fresh green nests, and closeness of weave and external appearance did not seem to be as important as strength of materials. There was a high correlation between age of nests and their acceptability. Females ignore old nests that have faded to a dull brown, but painting such nests green did not restore their attractiveness.

This belief was recently revised by several studies showing that various bird species, including passerines, use olfaction in many respects of life. During courtship and nest building, male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) incorporate aromatic herbs that are rich in volatile compounds (e. g., milfoil, Achillea millefolium) into the nests and they use olfactory cues to identify these plants. Interestingly, European starlings show seasonal differences in their ability to respond to odour cues: odour sensitivity peaks during nest-building in the spring, but is almost non-existent during the non-breeding season. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used repeated in vivo Manganese-enhanced MRI to quantify for the first time possible seasonal changes in the anatomy and activity of the OB in starling brains. We demonstrated that the OB of the starling exhibits a functional seasonal plasticity of certain plant odour specificity and that the OB is only able to detect milfoil odour during the breeding season. Volumetric analysis showed that this seasonal change in activity is not linked to a change in OB volume. By subsequently experimentally elevating testosterone (T) in half of the males during the non-breeding season we showed that the OB volume was increased compared to controls. Conclusions/Significance: By investigating the neural substrate of seasonal olfactory sensitivity changes we show that the starlings' OB loses its ability during the non-breeding season to detect a natural odour of a plant preferred as green nest material by male starlings. We found that testosterone, applied during the non-breeding season, does not restore the discriminatory ability of the OB but has an influence on its size.",4,2,selected,NA
