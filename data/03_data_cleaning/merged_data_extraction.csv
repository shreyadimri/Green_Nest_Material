We predict that the greenery should increase the amount of nesting interferences caused by the increase in aggressiveness between females during nest construction, laying and incubation, leading to an increase in female androgen levels."" Therefore, we expect a positive relationship between testosterone and GNM. Females were measured when they started laying (second or third egg) and this measurement would then imply that the testosterone levels are increased due to mate competition so we give it a positive sign.  One measure of testosterone was taken for each female and the levels of testosterone could change considerably within the duration of a day or a few days.

Blood glucose levels could change very rapidly depending on the consumption of food and there could be great between individual variation in the population. Circadian rhythm could also influence the blood sugar levels. 2.
