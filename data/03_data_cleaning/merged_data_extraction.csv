Authors say : ""Hence, to estimate variation in incubation period, on incubation day 13 at noon we checked for hatching and early postnatal development of hatchlings. We scored each egg or hatchling as follows: egg =  score 0 (assumed to hatch on the following day; retained only if eggs later hatched); wet hatchling = score 1 (assumed to have hatched on this same day); dry hatchling = score 2 (assumed to have hatched the preceding day). These data formed the basis for a combined developmental score per nest, where higher scores indicated shorter incubation""",1,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.425c941","NA","a","TR","data extracted from dataset at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.425c941","JMGS","I noticed that the authors shared their dataset, and that the data extractor (TR) did not extract, or mentioned it. therefore I extracted the data myself from dataset ""Gwinner_etal_2018_clutchoverview"" found at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.425c941; additionally I included ""b"" for the time of addiction as we discussed in our last meeting that this time refers to the experimental setup and not how it happens in nature.","no","yes","no",1,1

Blood glucose levels could change very rapidly depending on the consumption of food and there could be great between individual variation in the population. Circadian rhythm could also influence the blood sugar levels. 2.
