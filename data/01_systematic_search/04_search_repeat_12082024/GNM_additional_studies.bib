	abstract = {Nest fumigation behavior involves the incorporation of fresh green plant fragments that contain ectoparasite-repellent volatile compounds into birds’ nests. This behavior is relatively rare among bird species, and there is ongoing debate about whether it benefits parental breeding success. In this study, we experimentally tested whether the inclusion of aromatic-herbal plant fragments in the nests of great tits Parus major affects the physiological condition of nestlings, as indicated by blood levels of hematocrit, hemoglobin, glucose, and body condition indices, such as weight and wing length. We divided the nests into 2 groups, adding aromatic herbs to the test group’s nests and non-aromatic plants to the control group. After the nestlings fledged, all nest materials were collected to extract, identify, and count arthropod ectoparasites. Nestlings in nests supplemented with aromatic plant fragments had elevated levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin, indicating improved physiological condition compared to the control group. Ectoparasites were present in both groups, although ticks (Ixodidae) occurred less frequently in nests with aromatic plants. The experimental treatment did not affect fledging success. Further experimental studies are needed to explore the effects of incorporating aromatic plant fragments into tit nests within the frameworks of both the nest protection hypothesis and the drug hypothesis.},

	volume = {59},
	doi = {10.1006/anbe.1999.1306},
	abstract = {European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, intermingle fresh herbs, especially species rich in volatile compounds, with their otherwise dry nest material. In this field study we investigated whether these herbs reduce ectoparasites and thereby protect nestlings (the nest protection hypothesis). We also considered whether volatile compounds in herbs improve the condition of nestlings (the drug hypothesis). As measures of condition we used body mass, haematocrit levels and immunological parameters. We replaced 148 natural Starling nests with artificial ones: half contained-herbs and half (controls) contained grass. The ectoparasite loads (mites, lice, fleas) in herb and control nests were indistinguishable. However, nestlings in herb nests weighed more and had higher haematocrit levels at fledging than nestlings in control nests. Fledging success was similar in herb and control nests, but more yearlings from herb nests were identified iri the colony the year after hatching. The response of:the immune system when challenged with phytohaemagglutinin did not differ in nestlings from herb and control nests. Nestlings from herb nests had-more basophils and fewer lymphocytes in their blood than those from control nests, while the eosinophil and heterophil counts did not differ. We conclude that herbs do not reduce the number of ectoparasites, but they improve the condition of nestlings, perhaps by stimulating elements of the immune system that help them to cope better with the harmful activities of ectoparasites.
