Abstract = {The utility of fresh green material in avian nests is still not fully
   understood. Potential explanations include the effects of plants'
   volatile compounds on parasite reduction (nest protection hypothesis) or
   direct beneficial effects on nestling condition (drug hypothesis). We
   used correlative data collected during 2020 and 2021 in a Mediterranean
   population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as well as experimental
   data (aromatic nest content manipulation) to assess the effects of
   aromatic plant use on nestling physiological condition and survival,
   nest-dwelling ectoparasitic pressure and its relationship with breeding
   parameters. We found that aromatic plants were disproportionally used in
   relation to their abundance in the environment and that their use was
   positively related to egg mass (but only in 2020). Blowflies and
   facultative parasitic mites were more frequent in nests with aromatics
   compared to nests without aromatics, but obligatory parasitic mites were
   less abundant in nests with aromatics. However, no effects of aromatic
   plants were observed on nestling haemoglobin levels nor erythrocyte
   sedimentation rate or other physiological health metrics, but the
   heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in nests with the highest
   quantity of aromatics. The artificial addition of mint reduced the flea
   abundance, but 7-day old nestlings showed significantly lower colour
   saturation and brightness in the mouth flange. Nestling survival to
   fledging was not related to aromatic plant use. Therefore, our results
   partially support a beneficial effect of aromatic plants in blue tit
   nests because some ectoparasite groups were reduced. Immediate effects
   on nestling physiology or survival could not be established.
   Significance statementSome avian species place fresh aromatic plant
   material in their nests, and several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses
   have been proposed to explain its potential functions. In this study, we
   use both correlational and experimental data from a blue tit population
   to test two hypotheses, namely the `nest protection hypothesis' and the
   `drug hypothesis'. The first one proposes that aromatic plants have
   direct repellent effects against ectoparasites, while the latter poses
   that these plant components benefit nestling condition through the
   stimulation of some components of the immune system. Our results suggest
   that some ectoparasites, such as fleas and obligatory parasitic mites,
   were less abundant in nests where aromatic plants were artificially or
   naturally added, respectively, but no relationships were detected with
   nestling physiology or survival, which could be partially explained by
   our small sample size. Our study partially supports a beneficial effect
   of aromatic plants in avian nests.},

Title = {Early corticosterone increases vocal complexity in a wild parrot: An
   organizational role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in vocal
   learning?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 10},
Abstract = {The neuroendocrinology of vocal learning is exceptionally well known in
   passerine songbirds. Despite huge life history, genetic and ecological
   variation across passerines, song learning tends to occur as a result of
   rises in gonadal and non-gonadal sex steroids that shape telencephalic
   vocal control circuits and song. Parrots are closely related but
   independently evolved different cerebral circuits for vocal repertoire
   acquisition in both sexes that serve a broader suite of social functions
   and do not appear to be shaped by early androgens or estrogens; instead,
   parrots begin a plastic phase in vocal development at an earlier life
   history stage that favors the growth, maturation, and survival functions
   of corticosteroids. As evidence, corticosterone (CORT) supplements given
   to wild green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) during the first
   week of vocal babbling resulted in larger vocal repertoires in both
   sexes in the remaining days before fledging. Here, we replicate this
   experiment but began treatment 1 week before in development, analyzing
   both experiments in one model and a stronger test of the organizational
   effects of CORT on repertoire acquisition. Early CORT treatment resulted
   in significantly larger repertoires compared to late treatment. Both
   treatment groups showed weak negative effects on the early, reduplicated
   stage of babbling and strong, positive effects of CORT on the later,
   variegated stage. Results are consistent with more formative effects of
   corticosteroids at earlier developmental stages and a role of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in vocal repertoire
   acquisition. Given the early emergence of speech in human ontogeny,
   parrots are a promising model for understanding the putative role of the
   HPA axis in the construction of neural circuits that support language
   acquisition.
   This work shows that week-long corticosterone supplements given to
   pre-endothermic nestling parrots resulted in larger vocal repertoires
   than controls more than a week after treatment ended, and larger
   repertoires than a previous study where CORT was administered a week
   later in development. Results strongly suggest early, organizational
   effects of corticosteroids on vocal production learning and a beneficial
   role of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis in the development of
   complex social communication. This represents adeparture from the
   songbird model and the experimental support for the putative endocrine
   pathway that supports language precursors in human infants.image},

Title = {Eggshell spots are an important cue for the egg retrieval behavior in

Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},

Volume = {26},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It is a common occurrence for incubating female ground- or
   cavity-nesting birds to accidentally roll their own eggs out of the nest
   cup. To correctly roll eggs that are not in the nest cup back to the
   nest, birds must be able to discriminate between their eggs and things
   around their nests that could be easily confused for their eggs (e.g.,
   egg-shaped stones or other birds' eggs). Moreover, there may be a strong
   interaction between egg retrieval and egg rejection behaviors in the
   context of avian brood parasitism where recognition and rejection of
   alien eggs is an effective means for hosts to defend against cuckoo
   parasitism. It has been shown that green-backed tits (Parus monticolus)
   and Japanese tits (P. minor) in China have strong egg recognition
   ability and are able to reject nonmimetic eggs in the nest. Eggshell
   spots play an essential role in the egg rejection behavior of these two
   tit hosts. This study investigated the egg retrieval behavior of
   green-backed tits and Japanese tits by adding one experimental egg to
   the nest corner to explore whether eggshell spots also play a role in
   the process of egg retrieval. The results revealed significant
   differences in the retrieval rates of white-rumped munia (Lonchura
   striata) eggs painted with spots, Japanese tits' own true eggs, and
   unpainted, pure white-white-rumped munia eggs. The retrieval rate of
   white-white-rumped munia eggs was significantly lower than that of
   spotted white-rumped munia eggs and Japanese tits' own spotted eggs. For
   green-backed tits, the retrieval rate of spotted white-rumped munia eggs
   in the nest corner was significantly higher than that of pure
   white-white-rumped munia eggs, while the rejection rate of spotted
   white-rumped munia eggs was significantly lower than that of pure
   white-white-rumped munia eggs. These findings indicate that eggshell
   spots play a key role in the egg retrieval of green-backed tits and
   Japanese tits.},

Title = {Wetland management practices and secretive marsh bird habitat in the
   Mississippi Flyway: a review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Management regimes on publicly owned freshwater wetlands in the
   Mississippi Flyway of North America (i.e., Flyway) have historically
   emphasized waterfowl, but there is limited information on how
   waterfowl-focused wetland management affects other wetland-dependent
   wildlife. Secretive marsh birds (SMBs) depend on wetlands with emergent
   vegetation throughout their migratory life cycle and often encounter
   vegetation and water conditions resulting from waterfowl-focused
   management regimes. Thus, there is a need for better understanding of
   how SMBs are affected by wetland management and the extent to which
   waterfowl-focused management regimes provide habitat for SMBs. In this
   review, we identify the vegetation and water conditions resulting from
   typical management objectives on freshwater emergent wetlands in the
   Flyway, review and qualitatively synthesize results from studies that
   directly evaluate how wetland management practices affect SMBs or their
   habitat, and assess how the vegetation and water conditions being
   produced for target species (mainly waterfowl) align with SMB habitat
   requirements. We searched online databases and used Google Scholar to
   locate peer-reviewed literature, technical reports, and graduate theses
   that pertained to responses of SMBs or their habitat to water-level
   manipulation, herbicide application, prescribed fire, disking, mowing,
   and planting crops. There are several management strategies that
   complement SMBs and waterfowl, such as reducing cover of woody species
   and providing flooded emergent vegetation. We also highlight management
   strategies that may not currently align with SMB life-cycle needs and
   suggest adjustments that might promote habitat for SMBs while still
   achieving waterfowl population objectives. For example, adjusting the
   dates and duration of spring water-level drawdowns on a portion of
   wetlands within a larger complex can provide for spring migrating
   waterfowl and ensure habitat for migrating and nesting SMBs. Ideally,
   future studies would address how modifications to management practices
   affect SMBs and monitor potential effects on waterfowl, resulting in a
   more holistic approach to wetland management.},

   stress changes the morphological, physiological and biochemical
   responses of plants. Bird nest fern (Asplenium nidus) is typically an

   were used as an explant for In vitro propagation. After sterilization,
   the spores of Asplenium nidus were sprinkled over on MS initiation media
   of different strengths (1/2MS, 1/4 MS, 3/4 MS and Full MS). It was
   experiential that varying strength of nutrient components of the media
   has shown markedly influence. It was found that 90\% highest number of
   green prothalli, larger in size were germinated on 1/2 strength MS
   media. Prothalli shifted onto multiplication media which correspond 1/2
   strength MS medium supplemented with different growth regulators BAP
   (1-4 mg/L) and NAA (0.5-0.1 mg/L), 3\% sugar and 0.25\% w/v phytagel. It
   is observed that the F7 media showed an intense effect on the
   multiplication of plants, Plantlets multiplied vigorously were
   transferred onto differentiation media. In vitro differentiation of
   Asplenium nidus plantlets were optimized on differentiation media, MF
   media which corresponds with half -strength MS media supplemented with

   was incorporated in each combination at pH 5.75, Media containing
   NaH2PO4 showed different degrees of differentiation as compared to the
   media correspond with KH2PO4. The effect of liquid and solid supporting
   media on the rapid growth of micro propagated fern species Asplenium
   nidus was also studied about the accessibility of nutrients and water in
   the culture medium. In this study, two different types of media were
   used each restrain half -strength MS media containing growth regulators
   BAP (2mg/L), NAA (0.5mg/L) and IBA (2mg/L) respectively, along with the
   addition of 200 mg/L NaH2PO4. When shoots attained a sufficient length
   and become differentiated, then plants were transferred into auxin -rich
   media. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of different types
   and levels of auxins in rooting media. Differentiated plantlets were
   consequently shifted on medium for proliferation of root. Field trials
   experiments were designed and plantlets of Asplenium nidus were

Abstract = {Background: Populations of Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum are found
   in a wide portion of the Mexican territory, and it is ancestor of many
   cultivated forms relevant for the Mexican diet.
   Questions: What are the proportions of phenotypic and genetic variation
   distributed among its sampled regions, populations and within
   populations. How does the climate correlates to the population's
   phenotypic variation.
   Species: Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum.
   Study sites and years: 24 populations form three regions were sampled:
   Northwest, states of Sonora and Sinaloa; South: Oaxaca and Southeast
   Tabasco and Yucatan, in Mexico. The experiment was performed between
   years 2016 to 2018.
   Methods: Fruits from single plants were collected in wild populations.
   Plants were grown in a greenhouse. Nested ANOVAS were performed to
   estimate phenotypic and genetic variance components for different
   spatial scales. Climate correlation was estimated through univariate and
   multivariate methods.
   Results: 49.8 \% of phenotypic variation was detected within families,
   11.1 \% among families (within populations), 21.3 \% among populations
   and 17.6 \% among regions. The genetic basis of phenotypic variation was
   50.1\% on average, for this genetic variation 34.2 \% was found among
   regions, 39.4\% among populations and 26.3 \% within populations.
   Climate factors generated different patterns of correlations for
   vegetative, foliar and reproductive traits.
   Conclusions: Northwest plants were shorth, with small leaves and large
   fruits, Southeast plants were tall, with large leaves and small fruits,
   South plants developed intermediate phenotypic traits. Climate explained
   a large proportion of phenotypic differentiation.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) is an invasive nonnative legume
   that commonly occurs on sites managed for northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus). Sericea reduces bobwhite habitat availability by
   outcompeting native plants that provide food and cover. Sericea can be
   controlled with postemergence herbicides such as glyphosate as well as a
   mixture of triclopyr with fluroxypyr, but these herbicides do not
   provide preemergence control. Imazapic has been effective at controlling
   a limited number of planted sericea seeds, but the efficacy of imazapic
   at various application rates to control sericea seedbank response
   following treatment with a postemergence herbicide has not been
   evaluated. We designed a field experiment to evaluate sericea control
   and changes in the plant community as related to bobwhite habitat with 2
   postemergence herbicides followed by preemergence treatment of imazapic
   at 3 sites in Tennessee and Alabama, USA, 2018-2022. Specifically, we
   treated sericea with postemergence broadcast applications of glyphosate
   or triclopyr with fluroxypyr in 2018 and applied spot treatment with the
   same herbicides in 2019-2021. We applied imazapic at 4 rates following
   prescribed fire in 2019 and 2022. We measured coverage of sericea,
   native forbs, annual grasses, perennial grasses, and bobwhite food
   plants before treatment in 2018 and after all treatments in 2022. Nearly
   all postemergence treatments reduced sericea coverage, but imazapic did
   not increase control compared to postemergence herbicides alone.
   Perennial grasses used for nesting and bobwhite foraging were maintained
   following treatments. We recommend managers use either glyphosate or
   triclopyr with fluroxypyr to control sericea postemergence and consider
   using a low rate of imazapic to reduce annual grasses if coverage is a
   problem on the site.},

   species},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {199},
Pages = {141-149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In species with biparental care, the amount of care devoted to offspring
   is affected by the negotiation rules that the parents adopt. Theoretical
   models predict that biparental care can be evolutionarily stable if a
   decrease in parental investment by one parent is only partially
   compensated by its partner. However, empirical studies have found
   substantial variability in compensatory behaviour and have mainly used
   nesting provisioning as a single measure of parental effort. In this
   study, we investigated parental compensatory behaviour for two parental
   tasks, offspring provisioning and nest defence. These two tasks are
   likely characterized by different levels of risk as well as different
   cost and benefit functions for the parents, which may affect the
   expected level of compensatory responses. We experimentally widowed (by
   temporarily removing one parent) male or female Spanish sparrows, Passer
   hispaniolensis, and measured their compensatory responses to offspring
   provisioning and nest defence (after predator presentation of green whip
   snake, Hierophis viridiflavus, models). Parents differed in their
   compensatory responses in relation to parental task and sex: both sexes
   partially compensated for offspring provi-sioning, but females
   compensated by a larger degree than males. For predator defence, males
   instead decreased defence behaviour by increasing latency and reducing
   the number of attacks, while females did not change their behaviour when
   caring alone. This within-individual comparison indicates that parents
   adjust their compensatory behaviour according to parental task. We
   discuss how these differ-ences could arise due to different costs and
   benefits of extra investments. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {Humans are transforming natural habitats into managed urban green areas
   and impervious surfaces at an unprecedented pace. Yet the effects of
   human presence per se on animal life-history traits are rarely tested.
   This is particularly true in cities, where human presence is often
   indissociable from urbanisation itself. The onset of the SARS-CoV-2
   outbreak, along with the resulting lockdown restrictions, offered a
   unique, ``natural experiment `` to investigate wildlife responses to a
   sudden reduction in human activity. We analysed four years of avian
   breeding data collected in a European capital city to test whether
   lockdown measures altered nestbox occupancy and life-history traits in
   terms of egg laying date, incubation duration and clutch size in two
   urban adapters: great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes
   caeruleus). Lockdown measures, which modulated human presence, did not
   influence any of the life-history traits investigated. In contrast, the
   interaction between year and tree cover, a distinct ecological attribute
   of the urban space, was positively associated with clutch size, a key
   avian life-history and reproductive trait. This highlights the
   importance of inter-year variation and habitat quality over human
   activity on urban wildlife reproduction. We discuss our results in the
   light of other urban wildlife studies carried out during the pandemic,
   inviting the scientific community to carefully interpret all
   lockdown-associated shifts in biological traits.},

Abstract = {To investigate chemical compositions and antiviral activities of

   and Zingiber officinale) against two non-enveloped viruses (PV-1 and
   enterovirus type 1), human enteroviruses, chemical composition of LMEO
   and ZOEO was obtained by GC-MS. Biological activities such as inhibitory
   action on a-glucosidase, a-amylase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
   butyrylcholi-nesterase (BChE), tyrosinase and antioxidative potential of
   both EOs were evaluated. Respective cytotoxicity of LMEO and ZOEO
   towards RD (rhabdomyosarcoma) and L20B (a genetically engineered mouse
   cell line) were also determined by observation of the cell line carpet.
   In addition, Antiviral activity of LMEO and ZOEO against poliovirus type
   I and enterovirus type I was assessed using a cell culture cytopathic
   inhibition test. From the structure elucidation experiment, a total
   number of 23 and 30 compounds were respectively identi-fied for LMEO and
   ZOEO. Among both plant species, ZOEO significantly inhibited type I
   enterovirus activity by 50\% at 9.860 mu g/mL as compared to LMEO (44.47
   mu g/mL), respectively after 48 and 72 h of incubation. Fur-thermore,
   inhibition was statistically the same for studied essential oils (ZOEO:
   9 mu g/mL and LMEO: 9.077 mu g/mL). As a result of our findings, we
   concluded that the tested essential oils could be used as a source of
   natural antiviral agents in phytotherapeutic applications.(c) 2022 SAAB.

Title = {Reduction in biomass of freshwater arctic vegetation by foraging and
   nesting hyperabundant herbivores shows recovery},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Arctic-nesting geese are specialist herbivores of grasses and sedges
   (collectively, graminoids). Under moderate grazing pressure, these
   migratory herbivores can create and maintain arctic grazing lawns with
   high nutritional content and low aboveground biomass. Nutrient and
   energy subsidies from southern agricultural landscapes during winter
   have improved survival among populations of Ross's (Anser rossii) and
   lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens), leading to marked
   population growth. Resulting goose hyperabundance has raised
   conservation concern for resilience of arctic ecosystems to withstand
   cumulative and intense pressures of herbivory and nest construction. We
   used both design-based (experimental herbivore exclosures) and
   model-based methods to investigate changes to plant community structure
   in direct response to foraging and nesting by these species within the
   Queen Maud Gulf (Ahiak) Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, Canada.
   Annual nest construction and foraging by up to similar to 1.3 million
   geese at a large colony at Karrak Lake markedly reduced aboveground
   biomass of forage (graminoids) and non-forage (foliose and fruticose
   lichens) vegetation, with spatial variation in reduction associated with
   intensity of use by geese. Within vast brood-rearing regions, foraging
   reduced above- and belowground plant biomass of lowland plant
   communities by 61\% and 29\%, respectively, between 1994 (when herbivore
   exclosures were established) and 2017. In addition to landscape
   diversity associated with abiotic properties created by geomorphic
   processes, long-term herbivory by geese further increased spatial
   heterogeneity in vegetation at the landscape scale. Although foraging
   geese nearly completely depleted aboveground plant biomass in some parts
   of their brood-rearing areas, belowground biomass was largely conserved,
   and thus, plant communities had strong potential for aboveground
   regeneration. We propose that the effects of high-density nesting and
   foraging by Ross's and lesser snow geese in the central Canadian Arctic,
   while extensive, are ephemeral and prone to reversion following
   cessation of grazing and nesting pressure, such as that afforded by
   shifts in herbivore distribution or local population decline.},

Journal = {ANIMAL MICROBIOME},

Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Background The critically endangered kakapo is a flightless, nocturnal
   parrot endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. Recent efforts to describe the
   gastrointestinal microbial community of this threatened herbivore
   revealed a low-diversity microbiota that is often dominated by
   Escherichia-Shigella bacteria. Given the importance of associated
   microbial communities to animal health, and increasing appreciation of
   their potential relevance to threatened species conservation, we sought
   to better understand the development of this unusual gut microbiota
   profile. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of faecal
   material collected from kakapo chicks during the 2019 breeding season,
   in addition to associated nest litter material. Results Using an
   experimental approach rarely seen in studies of threatened species
   microbiota, we evaluated the impact of a regular conservation practice
   on the developing kakapo microbiota, namely the removal of faecal
   material from nests. Artificially removing chick faeces from nests had
   negligible impact on bacterial community diversity for either chicks or
   nests (p > 0.05). However, the gut microbiota did change significantly
   over time as chick age increased (p < 0.01), with an increasing relative
   abundance of Escherichia-Shigella coli over the study period and similar
   observations for the associated nest litter microbiota (p < 0.01).
   Supplementary feeding substantially altered gut bacterial diversity of
   kakapo chicks (p < 0.01), characterised by a significant increase in
   Lactobacillus bacteria. Conclusions Overall, chick age and hand rearing
   conditions had the most marked impact on faecal bacterial communities.
   Similarly, the surrounding nest litter microbiota changed significantly
   over time since a kakapo chick was first placed in the nest, though we
   found no evidence that removal of faecal material influenced the
   bacterial communities of either litter or faecal samples. Taken
   together, these observations will inform ongoing conservation and
   management of this most enigmatic of bird species.},

Abstract = {We study the superconducting pairing instabilities and gap functions for
   prototypical two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides
   (TMDCs) WS2, MoTe2, andMoS(2) in the 2H phase under both hole and
   electron doping at 10 K. Our first-principles quantum many-body Green's
   function approach allows us to treat the full d and p manifold of
   orbitals with strong spin-orbit coupling, yielding pairing predictions
   with material-specific detail. The resulting gap functions exhibit a
   variety of mixed-parity superconducting states, including s, p, d, f, d
   +/- id, and p +/- ip pairing modes. In particular, we predict 3\% and
   4\% hole-doped WS2 to be a chiral p +/- ip topological superconductor.
   For 1\% hole-doped MoS2, we find a competition between three doubly
   degenerate chiral and nonchiral instabilities. Overall, the relative
   pairing strengths are found to follow the Fermi-surface topology, due to
   nesting between the Fermi-surface sheets. Finally, we discuss our
   predictions in relation to available experimental data and classify the

Abstract = {Symptoms of bud proliferation and aborted seed pods were observed in

   Symptomatic and asymptomatic soybean and herbaceous plant samples were
   subjected to ELISA for virus detection and all samples were subjected to
   nested PCR amplification of phytoplasma 16 S ribosomal RNA gene followed
   by sequence and phylogenetic analysis. A `Candidatus Phytoplasma
   trifolii' strain was detected in the symptomatic soybean samples and in
   samples of willow and pampas grass. Some viruses were also detected in
   some the tested soybean samples. Biological assays such as insect and
   graft transmission were performed. Experimental infection of healthy
   soybean plants with symptomatic soybean shoots resulted in bud
   proliferation and seed pods abortion symptoms 8 weeks after grafting.
   The Hemiptera Creontiades pallidus known also as cotton shredder bug,
   transmitted `Ca. P. trifolii' to healthy soybean plants under insect
   proof conditions. The reported identification of the phytoplasmas
   associated with this soybean disease, of their reservoir or alternative

Abstract = {Psittacidae is one of the most endangered families of birds in the
   world. Knowledge of their nutrition is important for understanding their
   survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate
   husbandry under human care. Hand-rearing is a common practice for
   psittacines, however research on their nutrition is limited. We analysed
   the predicted metabolisable energy, crude protein, crude fat, minerals
   and the essential amino acid profiles of the crop contents from
   free-living nestlings of scarlet macaws (Ara macao) and red-and-green
   macaws (Ara chloropterus) from southeastern Peru, Cuban Amazons (Amazona
   leucocephala bahamensis) from the Bahamas, lilac-crowned Amazons
   (Amazona finschi) from northwestern Mexico and thick-billed parrots
   (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) from northern Mexico. The crop content of
   the different parrot species displayed remarkably similar nutritional
   profiles, considering their diversity in habitats, geographic ranges and
   food sources. The crude protein and crude fat concentrations in crop
   samples were particularly similar for the Ara and Amazona species, while
   the thick-billed parrot stood out for its higher crude fat and lower
   crude protein content. Wider variations were found among the
   concentrations of sodium (Na) and iron (Fe), proline and tryptophan.
   Compared with the requirements of 6-12 weeks leghorn chickens, all
   free-ranging parrot diets contained lower crude protein, calcium (Ca),
   potassium (P) and Na concentrations. The hand-feeding formulas contained
   lower crude fat, magnesium (Mg), arginine, valine and phenylalanine
   concentrations, as well as much higher levels of Ca and zinc (Zn), in
   comparison with parrot crop samples. Our data suggest that a single
   formulation could be used to hand-rear Ara and Amazona sp. of 3 weeks of
   age and older, while a different formulation would likely be more
   appropriated for Rhynchopsitta sp. Experimental studies should evaluate
   if increasing the concentration of crude fat, Mg, arginine, valine and
   phenylalanine enhances psittacine chick growth and health.},

Abstract = {Quantitative food web analyses can provide insights into the specificity
   of consumers such as herbivores, parasites and parasitoids.
   Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential
   benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for
   introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis
   downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is
   invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial
   mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental
   food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to
   test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi
   specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird
   nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird
   nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to
   assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of
   host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction
   strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within
   the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only
   Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of
   specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura
   annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of
   the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and
   preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species.
   Although there was some significant preference for particular bird
   species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove
   specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our
   results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C.
   annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce
   few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress
   populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental
   risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation
   on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {642},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {HZSM-5 catalysts with abundant silanol nests were fabricated by removing
   framework Al, which effectively promoted the selective alkylation of
   toluene with methanol by inhibiting the deep alkylation of aromatics to
   heavy aromatics and the conversion of methanol to light hydrocarbons.
   Correspondingly, the alkylation efficiency reached 65.3\% at a toluene
   conversion of 31.3\% over dealuminated HZSM-5, higher than the 55.2\%
   efficiency and 28.0\% conversion of parent zeolites, respectively. In
   situ DRIFTS and single-factor experimental clarified that toluene
   adsorption was enhanced and methanol to hydrocarbons was inhibited with
   the presence of silanol nests. Additionally, by increasing the crystal
   size of HZSM-5 with silanol nests from 2 to 5 mu m, para-xylene
   selectivity was increased from 36.1\% to 65.5\% because of the enhanced
   diffusion barrier. The finding of the positive effect of the silanol
   nests on toluene alkylation can provide a solid fundamental basis for

Abstract = {Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) is a widespread invasive grass in
   the United States that degrades habitat quality for biodiversity.
   Herbicide followed by seeding of native plants reduces tall fescue and
   is predicted to restore habitat quality over time, but little is known
   about short-term (1-2 year) impacts on native species. We conducted a
   landscape-scale controlled experiment to assess the short-term effects
   of herbicide and seeding on the reproduction of an obligate grassland
   bird, the dickcissel (Spiza americana). In 2014, four sites in southern
   Iowa were each subdivided into three patches (mean 7 ha). One patch in
   each site was treated with glyphosate herbicide (spray-only), one with
   herbicide and native seeding (spray-and-seed), with the third serving as
   a control. Two sites were grazed by cattle from April to July and two
   sites were ungrazed. We monitored dickcissel reproduction in 2016,
   finding that they were more abundant, built more nests, experienced less
   cowbird parasitism, had increased nest survival, and produced more
   fledglings on spray-only and spray-and-seed treatments compared to
   control patches. Dickcissels nested infrequently on grazed
   sites-especially grazed control patches. We did not detect any impacts
   on clutch size, provisioning rates, or nestling mass, but Araneae
   (spiders) and Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars) may have been smaller on
   sprayed patches. Positive responses by dickcissels were likely due to
   successful reduction of tall fescue and improved access to suitable nest
   sites through increased vegetation heterogeneity. Our results indicate
   that using herbicide and seeding to restore tall fescue-dominated sites
   improves habitat quality for this grassland bird, shortly after
   restoration.},
