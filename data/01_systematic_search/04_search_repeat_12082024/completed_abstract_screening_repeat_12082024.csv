Results from a correlational and an experimental study,"Garrido-Bautista, Jorge and Ramos, Jaime Albino and Arce, Sofia Irene and Melero-Romero, Pablo and Ferreira, Rafael and Santos-Baena, Carolina and Guimaro, H.

Potential explanations include the effects of plants' volatile compounds on parasite reduction (nest protection hypothesis) or direct beneficial effects on nestling condition (drug hypothesis). We used correlative data collected during 2020 and 2021 in a Mediterranean population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as well as experimental data (aromatic nest content manipulation) to assess the effects of aromatic plant use on nestling physiological condition and survival, nest-dwelling ectoparasitic pressure and its relationship with breeding parameters. We found that aromatic plants were disproportionally used in relation to their abundance in the environment and that their use was positively related to egg mass (but only in 2020). Blowflies and facultative parasitic mites were more frequent in nests with aromatics compared to nests without aromatics, but obligatory parasitic mites were less abundant in nests with aromatics. However, no effects of aromatic plants were observed on nestling haemoglobin levels nor erythrocyte sedimentation rate or other physiological health metrics, but the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in nests with the highest quantity of aromatics. The artificial addition of mint reduced the flea abundance, but 7-day old nestlings showed significantly lower colour saturation and brightness in the mouth flange. Nestling survival to fledging was not related to aromatic plant use. Therefore, our results partially support a beneficial effect of aromatic plants in blue tit nests because some ectoparasite groups were reduced. Immediate effects on nestling physiology or survival could not be established. Significance statementSome avian species place fresh aromatic plant material in their nests, and several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain its potential functions. In this study, we use both correlational and experimental data from a blue tit population to test two hypotheses, namely the `nest protection hypothesis' and the `drug hypothesis'. The first one proposes that aromatic plants have direct repellent effects against ectoparasites, while the latter poses that these plant components benefit nestling condition through the stimulation of some components of the immune system. Our results suggest that some ectoparasites, such as fleas and obligatory parasitic mites, were less abundant in nests where aromatic plants were artificially or naturally added, respectively, but no relationships were detected with nestling physiology or survival, which could be partially explained by our small sample size. Our study partially supports a beneficial effect of aromatic plants in avian nests.",1,SD,selected,NA

Despite huge life history, genetic and ecological variation across passerines, song learning tends to occur as a result of rises in gonadal and non-gonadal sex steroids that shape telencephalic vocal control circuits and song. Parrots are closely related but independently evolved different cerebral circuits for vocal repertoire acquisition in both sexes that serve a broader suite of social functions and do not appear to be shaped by early androgens or estrogens; instead, parrots begin a plastic phase in vocal development at an earlier life history stage that favors the growth, maturation, and survival functions of corticosteroids. As evidence, corticosterone (CORT) supplements given to wild green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) during the first week of vocal babbling resulted in larger vocal repertoires in both sexes in the remaining days before fledging. Here, we replicate this experiment but began treatment 1 week before in development, analyzing both experiments in one model and a stronger test of the organizational effects of CORT on repertoire acquisition. Early CORT treatment resulted in significantly larger repertoires compared to late treatment. Both treatment groups showed weak negative effects on the early, reduplicated stage of babbling and strong, positive effects of CORT on the later, variegated stage. Results are consistent with more formative effects of corticosteroids at earlier developmental stages and a role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in vocal repertoire acquisition. Given the early emergence of speech in human ontogeny, parrots are a promising model for understanding the putative role of the HPA axis in the construction of neural circuits that support language acquisition. This work shows that week-long corticosterone supplements given to pre-endothermic nestling parrots resulted in larger vocal repertoires than controls more than a week after treatment ended, and larger repertoires than a previous study where CORT was administered a week later in development. Results strongly suggest early, organizational effects of corticosteroids on vocal production learning and a beneficial role of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis in the development of complex social communication. This represents adeparture from the songbird model and the experimental support for the putative endocrine pathway that supports language precursors in human infants.image",1,SD,excluded,No green nest material
GNM_003_rep,ref_24,Eggshell spots are an important cue for the egg retrieval behavior in two tit species,Liu J.; Ma L.; Yang X.; Li B.; Wang X.; Liang W.,Animal Cognition,26,5,1697-1703,2023,10.1007/s10071-023-01814-w,"It is a common occurrence for incubating female ground- or cavity-nesting birds to accidentally roll their own eggs out of the nest cup. To correctly roll eggs that are not in the nest cup back to the nest, birds must be able to discriminate between their eggs and things around their nests that could be easily confused for their eggs (e.g., egg-shaped stones or other birds’ eggs). Moreover, there may be a strong interaction between egg retrieval and egg rejection behaviors in the context of avian brood parasitism where recognition and rejection of alien eggs is an effective means for hosts to defend against cuckoo parasitism. It has been shown that green-backed tits (Parus monticolus) and Japanese tits (P. minor) in China have strong egg recognition ability and are able to reject nonmimetic eggs in the nest. Eggshell spots play an essential role in the egg rejection behavior of these two tit hosts. This study investigated the egg retrieval behavior of green-backed tits and Japanese tits by adding one experimental egg to the nest corner to explore whether eggshell spots also play a role in the process of egg retrieval. The results revealed significant differences in the retrieval rates of white-rumped munia (Lonchura striata) eggs painted with spots, Japanese tits’ own true eggs, and unpainted, pure white-white-rumped munia eggs. The retrieval rate of white-white-rumped munia eggs was significantly lower than that of spotted white-rumped munia eggs and Japanese tits’ own spotted eggs. For green-backed tits, the retrieval rate of spotted white-rumped munia eggs in the nest corner was significantly higher than that of pure white-white-rumped munia eggs, while the rejection rate of spotted white-rumped munia eggs was significantly lower than that of pure white-white-rumped munia eggs. These findings indicate that eggshell spots play a key role in the egg retrieval of green-backed tits and Japanese tits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2,SD,excluded,No green nest material

Secretive marsh birds (SMBs) depend on wetlands with emergent vegetation throughout their migratory life cycle and often encounter vegetation and water conditions resulting from waterfowl-focused management regimes. Thus, there is a need for better understanding of how SMBs are affected by wetland management and the extent to which waterfowl-focused management regimes provide habitat for SMBs. In this review, we identify the vegetation and water conditions resulting from typical management objectives on freshwater emergent wetlands in the Flyway, review and qualitatively synthesize results from studies that directly evaluate how wetland management practices affect SMBs or their habitat, and assess how the vegetation and water conditions being produced for target species (mainly waterfowl) align with SMB habitat requirements. We searched online databases and used Google Scholar to locate peer-reviewed literature, technical reports, and graduate theses that pertained to responses of SMBs or their habitat to water-level manipulation, herbicide application, prescribed fire, disking, mowing, and planting crops. There are several management strategies that complement SMBs and waterfowl, such as reducing cover of woody species and providing flooded emergent vegetation. We also highlight management strategies that may not currently align with SMB life-cycle needs and suggest adjustments that might promote habitat for SMBs while still achieving waterfowl population objectives. For example, adjusting the dates and duration of spring water-level drawdowns on a portion of wetlands within a larger complex can provide for spring migrating waterfowl and ensure habitat for migrating and nesting SMBs. Ideally, future studies would address how modifications to management practices affect SMBs and monitor potential effects on waterfowl, resulting in a more holistic approach to wetland management.",2,SD,excluded,Not empirical

Sericea reduces bobwhite habitat availability by outcompeting native plants that provide food and cover. Sericea can be controlled with postemergence herbicides such as glyphosate as well as a mixture of triclopyr with fluroxypyr, but these herbicides do not provide preemergence control. Imazapic has been effective at controlling a limited number of planted sericea seeds, but the efficacy of imazapic at various application rates to control sericea seedbank response following treatment with a postemergence herbicide has not been evaluated. We designed a field experiment to evaluate sericea control and changes in the plant community as related to bobwhite habitat with 2 postemergence herbicides followed by preemergence treatment of imazapic at 3 sites in Tennessee and Alabama, USA, 2018–2022. Specifically, we treated sericea with postemergence broadcast applications of glyphosate or triclopyr with fluroxypyr in 2018 and applied spot treatment with the same herbicides in 2019–2021. We applied imazapic at 4 rates following prescribed fire in 2019 and 2022. We measured coverage of sericea, native forbs, annual grasses, perennial grasses, and bobwhite food plants before treatment in 2018 and after all treatments in 2022. Nearly all postemergence treatments reduced sericea coverage, but imazapic did not increase control compared to postemergence herbicides alone. Perennial grasses used for nesting and bobwhite foraging were maintained following treatments. We recommend managers use either glyphosate or triclopyr with fluroxypyr to control sericea postemergence and consider using a low rate of imazapic to reduce annual grasses if coverage is a problem on the site. © 2023 The Authors.

Theoretical models predict that biparental care can be evolutionarily stable if a decrease in parental investment by one parent is only partially compensated by its partner. However, empirical studies have found substantial variability in compensatory behaviour and have mainly used nesting provisioning as a single measure of parental effort. In this study, we investigated parental compensatory behaviour for two parental tasks, offspring provisioning and nest defence. These two tasks are likely characterized by different levels of risk as well as different cost and benefit functions for the parents, which may affect the expected level of compensatory responses. We experimentally widowed (by temporarily removing one parent) male or female Spanish sparrows, Passer hispaniolensis, and measured their compensatory responses to offspring provisioning and nest defence (after predator presentation of green whip snake, Hierophis viridiflavus, models). Parents differed in their compensatory responses in relation to parental task and sex: both sexes partially compensated for offspring provi-sioning, but females compensated by a larger degree than males. For predator defence, males instead decreased defence behaviour by increasing latency and reducing the number of attacks, while females did not change their behaviour when caring alone. This within-individual comparison indicates that parents adjust their compensatory behaviour according to parental task. We discuss how these differ-ences could arise due to different costs and benefits of extra investments. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the effects of human presence per se on animal life-history traits are rarely tested. This is particularly true in cities, where human presence is often indissociable from urbanisation itself. The onset of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, along with the resulting lockdown restrictions, offered a unique, ``natural experiment `` to investigate wildlife responses to a sudden reduction in human activity. We analysed four years of avian breeding data collected in a European capital city to test whether lockdown measures altered nestbox occupancy and life-history traits in terms of egg laying date, incubation duration and clutch size in two urban adapters: great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Lockdown measures, which modulated human presence, did not influence any of the life-history traits investigated. In contrast, the interaction between year and tree cover, a distinct ecological attribute of the urban space, was positively associated with clutch size, a key avian life-history and reproductive trait. This highlights the importance of inter-year variation and habitat quality over human activity on urban wildlife reproduction.

Biological activities such as inhibitory action on a-glucosidase, a-amylase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholi-nesterase (BChE), tyrosinase and antioxidative potential of both EOs were evaluated. Respective cytotoxicity of LMEO and ZOEO towards RD (rhabdomyosarcoma) and L20B (a genetically engineered mouse cell line) were also determined by observation of the cell line carpet. In addition, Antiviral activity of LMEO and ZOEO against poliovirus type I and enterovirus type I was assessed using a cell culture cytopathic inhibition test. From the structure elucidation experiment, a total number of 23 and 30 compounds were respectively identi-fied for LMEO and ZOEO. Among both plant species, ZOEO significantly inhibited type I enterovirus activity by 50\% at 9.860 mu g/mL as compared to LMEO (44.47 mu g/mL), respectively after 48 and 72 h of incubation.

GNM_011_rep,ref_09,Reduction in biomass of freshwater arctic vegetation by foraging and nesting hyperabundant herbivores shows recovery,Kellett D.K.; Alisauskas R.T.,Ecosphere,13,11,-,2022,10.1002/ecs2.4275,"Arctic-nesting geese are specialist herbivores of grasses and sedges (collectively, graminoids). Under moderate grazing pressure, these migratory herbivores can create and maintain arctic grazing lawns with high nutritional content and low aboveground biomass. Nutrient and energy subsidies from southern agricultural landscapes during winter have improved survival among populations of Ross's (Anser rossii) and lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens), leading to marked population growth. Resulting goose hyperabundance has raised conservation concern for resilience of arctic ecosystems to withstand cumulative and intense pressures of herbivory and nest construction. We used both design-based (experimental herbivore exclosures) and model-based methods to investigate changes to plant community structure in direct response to foraging and nesting by these species within the Queen Maud Gulf (Ahiak) Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, Canada. Annual nest construction and foraging by up to ~1.3 million geese at a large colony at Karrak Lake markedly reduced aboveground biomass of forage (graminoids) and non-forage (foliose and fruticose lichens) vegetation, with spatial variation in reduction associated with intensity of use by geese. Within vast brood-rearing regions, foraging reduced above- and belowground plant biomass of lowland plant communities by 61% and 29%, respectively, between 1994 (when herbivore exclosures were established) and 2017. In addition to landscape diversity associated with abiotic properties created by geomorphic processes, long-term herbivory by geese further increased spatial heterogeneity in vegetation at the landscape scale. Although foraging geese nearly completely depleted aboveground plant biomass in some parts of their brood-rearing areas, belowground biomass was largely conserved, and thus, plant communities had strong potential for aboveground regeneration. We propose that the effects of high-density nesting and foraging by Ross's and lesser snow geese in the central Canadian Arctic, while extensive, are ephemeral and prone to reversion following cessation of grazing and nesting pressure, such as that afforded by shifts in herbivore distribution or local population decline. © 2022 The Authors.

Recent efforts to describe the gastrointestinal microbial community of this threatened herbivore revealed a low-diversity microbiota that is often dominated by Escherichia-Shigella bacteria. Given the importance of associated microbial communities to animal health, and increasing appreciation of their potential relevance to threatened species conservation, we sought to better understand the development of this unusual gut microbiota profile. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of faecal material collected from kākāpō chicks during the 2019 breeding season, in addition to associated nest litter material. Results: Using an experimental approach rarely seen in studies of threatened species microbiota, we evaluated the impact of a regular conservation practice on the developing kākāpō microbiota, namely the removal of faecal material from nests. Artificially removing chick faeces from nests had negligible impact on bacterial community diversity for either chicks or nests (p > 0.05). However, the gut microbiota did change significantly over time as chick age increased (p < 0.01), with an increasing relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella coli over the study period and similar observations for the associated nest litter microbiota (p < 0.01). Supplementary feeding substantially altered gut bacterial diversity of kākāpō chicks (p < 0.01), characterised by a significant increase in Lactobacillus bacteria. Conclusions: Overall, chick age and hand rearing conditions had the most marked impact on faecal bacterial communities. Similarly, the surrounding nest litter microbiota changed significantly over time since a kākāpō chick was first placed in the nest, though we found no evidence that removal of faecal material influenced the bacterial communities of either litter or faecal samples. Taken together, these observations will inform ongoing conservation and management of this most enigmatic of bird species. © 2022, The Author(s).",2,SD,excluded,No green nest material

The resulting gap functions exhibit a variety of mixed-parity superconducting states, including s, p, d, f, d +/- id, and p +/- ip pairing modes. In particular, we predict 3\% and 4\% hole-doped WS2 to be a chiral p +/- ip topological superconductor. For 1\% hole-doped MoS2, we find a competition between three doubly degenerate chiral and nonchiral instabilities. Overall, the relative pairing strengths are found to follow the Fermi-surface topology, due to nesting between the Fermi-surface sheets.

The crop content of the different parrot species displayed remarkably similar nutritional profiles, considering their diversity in habitats, geographic ranges and food sources. The crude protein and crude fat concentrations in crop samples were particularly similar for the Ara and Amazona species, while the thick-billed parrot stood out for its higher crude fat and lower crude protein content. Wider variations were found among the concentrations of sodium (Na) and iron (Fe), proline and tryptophan. Compared with the requirements of 6-12 weeks leghorn chickens, all free-ranging parrot diets contained lower crude protein, calcium (Ca), potassium (P) and Na concentrations. The hand-feeding formulas contained lower crude fat, magnesium (Mg), arginine, valine and phenylalanine concentrations, as well as much higher levels of Ca and zinc (Zn), in comparison with parrot crop samples. Our data suggest that a single formulation could be used to hand-rear Ara and Amazona sp. of 3 weeks of age and older, while a different formulation would likely be more appropriated for Rhynchopsitta sp. Experimental studies should evaluate if increasing the concentration of crude fat, Mg, arginine, valine and phenylalanine enhances psittacine chick growth and health.",2,SD,excluded,Not experimental

Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.",1,SD,excluded,No green nest material

Herbicide followed by seeding of native plants reduces tall fescue and is predicted to restore habitat quality over time, but little is known about short-term (1–2 year) impacts on native species. We conducted a landscape-scale controlled experiment to assess the short-term effects of herbicide and seeding on the reproduction of an obligate grassland bird, the dickcissel (Spiza americana). In 2014, four sites in southern Iowa were each subdivided into three patches (mean 7 ha). One patch in each site was treated with glyphosate herbicide (spray-only), one with herbicide and native seeding (spray-and-seed), with the third serving as a control. Two sites were grazed by cattle from April to July and two sites were ungrazed. We monitored dickcissel reproduction in 2016, finding that they were more abundant, built more nests, experienced less cowbird parasitism, had increased nest survival, and produced more fledglings on spray-only and spray-and-seed treatments compared to control patches. Dickcissels nested infrequently on grazed sites—especially grazed control patches. We did not detect any impacts on clutch size, provisioning rates, or nestling mass, but Araneae (spiders) and Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars) may have been smaller on sprayed patches. Positive responses by dickcissels were likely due to successful reduction of tall fescue and improved access to suitable nest sites through increased vegetation heterogeneity. Our results indicate that using herbicide and seeding to restore tall fescue-dominated sites improves habitat quality for this grassland bird, shortly after restoration. © 2022 The Authors.

Tests of egg discrimination ability by cavity-nesting tits under dim light conditions may reveal the selection pressure from brood parasitism that they encounter under natural interactions. We manipulated the intensity of luminance of nests of the Green-backed Tit (Parus monticolus), a potential cuckoo host that possesses a strong discrimination ability of non-mimetic foreign eggs. We performed experiments to test their egg discrimination ability under different light conditions. Our results showed that Green-backed Tits discriminate against non-mimetic foreign eggs under normal light conditions in nest boxes, and this ability persisted at nest luminance as low as 4.78 ​± ​1.31 lux that is several times lower than normal luminance (38.11 ​± ​24.02 lux). However, egg discrimination by Green-backed Tits disappeared when nest luminance was reduced to a minimum of 0.35 ​± ​0.15 lux. The latter value represents total darkness for humans. The present study shows that nest luminance plays a key role in egg discrimination by Green-backed Tits that build nests under dim light conditions.

A novel mechanism for somatic stem cell differentiation via phagocytosing ‘model cells’ (apoptotic differentiated cells) was found to require only a short time frame. Pluripotent-like Muse cells, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs) phagocytosed apoptotic differentiated cells via different phagocytic receptor subsets than macrophages. The phagocytosed-differentiated cell-derived contents (e.g., transcription factors) were quickly released into the cytoplasm, translocated into the nucleus, and bound to promoter regions of the stem cell genomes. Within 24 ~ 36 h, the cells expressed lineage-specific markers corresponding to the phagocytosed-differentiated cells, both in vitro and in vivo. At 1 week, the gene expression profiles were similar to those of the authentic differentiated cells and expressed functional markers. Differentiation was limited to the inherent potential of each cell line: triploblastic-, adipogenic-/chondrogenic-, and neural-lineages in Muse cells, MSCs, and NSCs, respectively. Disruption of phagocytosis, either by phagocytic receptor inhibition via small interfering RNA or annexin V treatment, impeded differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings uncovered a simple mechanism by which differentiation-directing factors are directly transferred to somatic stem cells by phagocytosing apoptotic differentiated cells to trigger their rapid differentiation into the target cell lineage. © 2022, The Author(s).",1,SD,excluded,Out of field

While sexually selected infanticide is well known, evidence for sexually selected adoption is anecdotal. We report on both behaviors at 346 nests over 27 y in green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela. Parrotlets are monogamous with long-term pair bonds, exhibit a strongly male-biased adult sex ratio, and nest in cavities that are in short supply, creating intense competition for nest sites and mates. Infanticide attacks occurred at 256 nests in two distinct contexts: 1) Attacks were primarily committed by nonbreeding pairs (69%) attempting to evict parents from the cavity. Infanticide attacks per nest were positively correlated with population size and evicting pairs never adopted abandoned offspring. Competition for limited nest sites was a primary cause of eviction-driven infanticide, and 2) attacks occurred less frequently at nests where one mate died (31%), was perpetrated primarily by stepparents of both sexes, and was independent of population size. Thus, within a single species and mating system, infanticide occurred in multiple contexts due to multiple drivers. Nevertheless, 48% of stepparents of both sexes adopted offspring, and another 23% of stepfathers exhibited both infanticide and long-term care. Stepfathers were often young males who subsequently nested with widows, reaching earlier ages of first breeding than competitors and demonstrating sexually selected adoption. Adoption and infanticide conferred similar fitness benefits to stepfathers and appeared to be equivalent strategies driven by limited breeding opportunities, male-biased sex ratios, and long-term monogamy.

Depending on the cell source, additional limitations to NPC-based therapies include high tumorigenic potential, alongside poor graft survival and engraftment into host spinal tissue. We previously demonstrated that NPCs derived from rat fetal spinal cords primed with a polyglutamate (PGA)-conjugated form of the Rho/Rock inhibitor fasudil (PGA-SS-FAS) displayed enhanced neuronal differentiation and graft survival when compared to non-primed NPCs. We now conducted a similar study of human-fetal-spinal-cord-derived NPCs (hfNPCs) from legal gestational interruptions at the late gestational stage, at 19–21.6 weeks. In vitro, expanded hfNPCs retained neural features, multipotency, and self-renewal, which supported the development of a cell banking strategy. Before transplantation, we established a simple procedure to prime hfNPCs by overnight incubation with PGA-SS-FAS (at 50 μM FAS equiv.), which improved neuronal differentiation and overcame neurite-like retraction after lysophosphatidic-acid-induced Rho/Rock activation. The transplantation of primed hfNPCs into immune-deficient mice (NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu) immediately after the eighth thoracic segment compression prompted enhanced migration of grafted cells from the dorsal to the ventral spinal cord, increased preservation of GABAergic inhibitory Lbx1-expressing and glutamatergic excitatory Tlx3-expressing somatosensory interneurons, and elevated the numbers of preserved, c-Fos-expressing, activated neurons surrounding the injury epicenter, all in a low percentage. Overall, the priming procedure using PGA-SS-FAS could represent an alternative methodology to improve the capabilities of the hfNPC lines for a translational approach for acute SCI treatment. © 2022 by the authors.",1,SD,excluded,Out of field

The somata of DAN cells are located toward the lumen of the ventricle forming multiple layers in close association with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A single process emerges from the soma and run with the blood vessels. Cells of the DAN express radial glia/stem cell markers such as GFAP, vimentin and nestin, and the glutamate transporter GLAST or the oligodendrocyte precursor/pericyte marker NG2, thereby suggesting their potential for the generation of new cells. Morphologically, DAN cells resemble tanycytes of the third ventricle, which transfer biochemical signals from the CSF to the central nervous system and display proliferative capacity.

This small inhabited island is free of middle-to large-sized wildlife and a crucial stopover for wild birds migrating along various routes of the East Asian Flyway. A 5-year survey was conducted to explore the biogeography of ticks and tick-borne microorganisms. By flagging vegetation, Ixodes pavlovskyi (Pomerantzev, 1948), distributed in limited spots in the Far East, was predominantly collected (60%–80% collection) throughout the survey period. The I. pavlovskyi consisted of two haplogroups, Asahikawa-type and Rishiri-type, with the prevalence and nucleotide diversity of Rishiri-type being over 90% and 0.068, respectively. A survey of wild animals revealed that red-backed voles and wild birds, including Oriental greenfinches and black-faced buntings, are their hosts for blood feeding. Furthermore, the red-backed voles were infected with tick-borne Candidatus Ehrlichia khabarensis (5/21, 24%). Till date, microorganisms with identical gene sequences have only been reported from Khabarovsk and Vancouver. Ca. E. khabarensis gene has also been detected in host-seeking adult I. pavlovskyi. These results indicated that Rishiri Island is a refuge for both I. pavlovskyi and I. pavlovskyi–borne microorganisms. Additionally, the Babesia microti US lineage, which is vectored by Ixodes persulcatus in the Far East, appears to be maintained between I. pavlovskyi and wild rodents. Various factors have influenced the unique ecosystem of the island.

A feature selection algorithm was employed to create and select an ensemble of fine-scale, top-ranked MaxEnt models from optimally-sized, decorrelated subsets of four to seven of 199 potential variables. Variables were ranked post hoc by frequency of appearance and mean permutation importance in top-ranked models.

Aim of the study: This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which KXS exerts its therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting ferroptosis, using a combination of network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation strategies. Materials and methods: The active target sites and the further potential mechanisms of KXS in protecting against AD were investigated through molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and network pharmacology, and combined with the validation of animal experiments. Results: Computational and experimental findings provide the first indication that KXS significantly improves learning and memory defects and inhibits neuronal ferroptosis by repairing mitochondria damage and upregulating the protein expression of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) in vivo APP/PS1 mice AD model. According to bioinformatics analysis, the mechanism by which KXS inhibits ferroptosis may involve SIRT1. KXS notably upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of SIRT1 in both vivo APP/PS1 mice and in vitro APP-overexpressed HT22 cells. Additionally, KXS inhibited ferroptosis induced by APP-overexpression in HT22 cells through activating the SIRT1-FSP1 signal pathway. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings suggest that KXS may inhibit neuronal ferroptosis through activating the SIRT1/FSP1 signaling pathway. This study reveals the scientific basis and underlying modern theory of replenishing qi and eliminating phlegm, which involves the inhibition of ferroptosis. Moreover, it highlights the potential application of SIRT1 or FSP1 activators in the treatment of AD and other ferroptosis-related diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",1,SD,excluded,Out of field

Median survival time remains at 16-20 months despite multimodal treatment with surgical resection, radiation, temozolomide and tumor-treating fields therapy. After genotoxic stress glioma cells initiate cytoprotective autophagy, which contributes to treatment resistance, limiting the efficacy of these therapies and providing an avenue for glioma recurrence. Antagonism of autophagy steps has recently gained attention as it may enhance the efficacy of classical chemotherapies and newer immune-stimulating therapies. The modulation of autophagy in the clinic is limited by the low potency of common autophagy inhibitors and the inability of newer ones to cross the blood-brain barrier. Herein, we leverage lucanthone, an anti-schistosomal agent which crosses the blood-brain barrier and was recently reported to act as an autophagy inhibitor in breast cancer cells. Our studies show that lucanthone was toxic to glioma cells by inhibiting autophagy. It enhanced anti-glioma temozolomide (TMZ) efficacy at sub-cytotoxic concentrations, and suppressed the growth of stem-like glioma cells and temozolomide-resistant glioma stem cells. In vivo lucanthone slowed tumor growth: reduced numbers of Olig2+ glioma cells, normalized tumor vasculature, and reduced tumor hypoxia. We propose that lucanthone may serve to perturb a mechanism of temozolomide resistance and allow for successful treatment of TMZ-resistant glioblastoma.

Because iSCs are stem cells induced under pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke, the use of human brain-derived iSCs (h-iSCs) may represent a novel therapy for stroke patients. We performed a preclinical study by transplanting h-iSCs transcranially into post-stroke mouse brains 6 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Compared with PBS-treated controls, h-iSC transplantation significantly improved neurological function. To identify the underlying mechanism, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled h-iSCs were transplanted into post-stroke mouse brains. Immunohistochemistry revealed that GFP+ h-iSCs survived around the ischemic areas and some differentiated into mature neuronal cells. To determine the effect on endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) by h-iSC transplantation, mCherry-labeled h-iSCs were administered to Nestin-GFP transgenic mice which were subjected to MCAO. As a result, many GFP+ NSPCs were observed around the injured sites compared with controls, indicating that mCherry+ h-iSCs activate GFP+ endogenous NSPCs. In support of these findings, coculture studies revealed that the presence of h-iSCs promotes the proliferation of endogenous NSPCs and increases neurogenesis. In addition, coculture experiments indicated neuronal network formation between h-iSC- and NSPC-derived neurons. These results suggest that h-iSCs exert positive effects on neural regeneration through not only neural replacement by grafted cells but also neurogenesis by activated endogenous NSPCs.

The composition of the surroundings where the beehive is located is important for the health of the nests and quality of the bee products. This work used bee capture and release techniques to evaluate the use of this methodology for releasing and monitoring native bees in urban areas and to identify whether proportion of green and gray urban nature areas affect the flying activities of stingless bees in an urban landscape. We used nests of Melipona quadrifasciata (mandaçaia), a species of stingless bee native to the Atlantic Rainforest, from three meliponaries located in different parts of the city of São Paulo. The travel time of bees in the landscape were related to the green urban areas up to 900 m in diameter from the meliponaries. Although we did not find a relationship between green areas and bee return times and numbers, it was noticeable that there was variation between the study areas, indicating that the release and monitoring methodology can be used in urban areas following the recommended modifications.

Yet, eliminating the latent reservoirs of HIV to achieve a cure remains an unmet need. The advent of nanomedicine has revolutionized the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The present study explores a unique combination of Tenofovir (TNF) with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a potential therapeutic approach to overcome several limitations of the current ART. Results: TNF-tethered AuNPs were successfully synthesized. Cell viability, genotoxicity, haemolysis, and histopathological studies confirmed the complete safety of the preparation. Most importantly, its anti-HIV1 reverse transcriptase activity was ~ 15 folds higher than the native TNF. In addition, it exhibited potent anti-HIV1 protease activity, a much sought-after target in anti-HIV1 therapeutics. Finally, the in vivo biodistribution studies validated that the AuNPs could reach many tissues/organs, serving as a secure nest for HIV and overcoming the problem of deficient drug delivery to HIV reservoirs. Conclusions: We show that the combination of TNF and AuNPs exhibits multifunctional activity, viz. anti-HIV1 and anti-HIV1 protease. These findings are being reported for the first time and highlight the prospects of developing AuNP-TNF as a novel next-generation platform to treat HIV/AIDS.

Additionally, important components of a species' adaptive capacity, such as evolutionary potential, are often not included in quantitative risk assessments due to lack of data. While genomic proxies for evolutionary potential in at-risk species are increasingly available, they have not yet been included in extinction risk assessments at a species-wide scale. In this study, we used an individual-based, spatially explicit, dynamic eco-evolutionary simulation model to evaluate the extinction risk of an endangered desert songbird, the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus), in response to climate change. Using data from long-term demographic and habitat studies in conjunction with genome-wide ecological genomics research, we parameterized simulations that include 418 sites across the breeding range, genomic data from 225 individuals, and climate change forecasts spanning 3 generalized circulation models and 3 emissions scenarios. We evaluated how evolutionary potential, and the lack of it, impacted population trajectories in response to climate change. We then investigated the compounding impact of drought and warming temperatures on extinction risk through the mechanism of increased nest failure. Finally, we evaluated how rapid action to reverse greenhouse gas emissions would influence population responses and species extinction risk. Our results illustrate the value of incorporating evolutionary, demographic, and dispersal processes in a spatially explicit framework to more comprehensively evaluate the extinction risk of threatened and endangered species and conservation actions to promote their recovery.  © 2023 The Author(s).

The results of a review on the factors that affect nitrogen fixation in the Inga-café system are presented. The nitrogen contribution that the Inga Miller tree genus provides to shade coffee plantations and the factors that affect its stability in biological nitrogen fixation are scarcely recognized. This work delves into the ecological factors and glyphosate herbicides that can affect the symbiosis of Inga spp. with diazotrophic bacteria in their roots (rhizobia), which form nodules and carry out biological nitrogen fixation. Methodology. Different information sources such as EBSCO, Scopus and Google Schoolar were reviewed, with logical or Boolean data search. 183 papers were used to address the factors that affect the symbiosis between trees of the Inga genus and rhizobia. The findings were organized in: Inga Miller taxonomy, shade coffee plantations with Inga spp., symbiosis between Inga spp. and Bradyrhizobium spp., ecological factors that affect the functioning of the Inga spp.-rhizobia symbiosis and the agrochemical factor: glyphosate herbicide. Results. The genus Inga is recognized as a clade Mimosoideae nested in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Shade coffee plantations with Inga are established below 23ºN and 30ºS, up to 3,100 m.a.s.l. and the symbiont genus is predominantly Bradyrhizobium spp. whose ecological limits of Inga spp-rhizobia were: altitude [988.7-1,381.5 m.a.s.l.], annual precipitation [2,048.4-2,064.36 mm], temperature [20.39-21.93 ºC] and soil pH [4.88-5.42 pH]. Glyphosated herbicides, as an external stimulus, can reduce the benefit of biological nitrogen fixation and erode the soil by keeping it devoid of vegetation. Additionally, some Bradyrhizobium spp. (thiO gene), which oxidizes glyphosate to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), could be a potential glyphosate degrader in the soil. Implications. Shade coffee plantations with 205-250 trees per hectare of Inga spp. allow fixing around 45 kg of N ha-1 year-1. This review may allow the adoption of new observational or experimental studies of the Inga spp.-rhizobia symbiosis, to approach the performance that favors the biological fixation of nitrogen in shade coffee plantations. Conclusions. The review indicates that there is a specific association between Inga spp. and Bradyrhizobium spp., that ecological factors, including the agronomic management with glyphosated herbicides can decrease nitrogen fixation performance during the symbiosis between Inga spp. and rhizobia. No systematic studies of the symbiosis-environment-agrochemical interaction in shade coffee plantations were found. Copyright © the authors.",1,SD,excluded,Not birds

Plastic is increasingly used as a material for nest boxes, but no studies have investigated effects of this different material. Two consecutive studies were conducted to investigate effects of nest-box environment on nidicolous parasites, bacteria and fungi, as well as nest success, in blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major. The first compared microclimate and parasite and pathogen load in plastic and wooden nest boxes. The second tested the nest protection hypothesis-that birds naturally incorporate aromatic herbs into nests to decrease nest parasites and pathogens-by comparing parasite and pathogen load in plastic nest boxes to which aromatic or non-aromatic plant material was added. No significant difference in nest-box temperature or relative humidity was found between plastic and wooden boxes. Wooden boxes, however, contained 30-fold higher numbers of fleas and a higher total bacterial load on chicks. Fledging success for blue tit broods was significantly higher in wooden boxes. Parasites and bacteria did not decrease by the inclusion of aromatic herbs. The results increase the evidence base for nest-box design in support of plastic, which can provide an appropriate alternative nest-box material to wood, with apparently no difference in microclimate and no increase in the load of measured parasites and pathogens.

WNV and USUV and potentially also BAGV constitute zoonoses. Temporal and spatial cocirculation and coinfection with Plasmodium spp., and West Nile virus has been documented in birds and mosquito vectors, and fatally USUV-infected passerines coinfected with Plasmodium spp. had more severe lesions. Also, WNV, USUV and BAGV have been found to cocirculate. Yet little is known about the interaction of BAGV and malaria parasites during consecutive or coinfections of avian hosts. Here we report mortality of free-living red-legged partridges in a hunting estate in Southern Spain that were coinfected with BAGV and Plasmodium spp. The outbreak occurred in the area where BAGV first emerged in Europe in 2010 and where cocirculation of BAGV, USUV and WNV was confirmed in 2011 and 2013. Partridges were found dead in early October 2019. Birds had mottled locally pale pectoral muscles, enlarged, congestive greenish-black tinged livers and enlarged kidneys. Microscopically congestion and predominantly mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were evident and Plasmodium phanerozoites were present in the liver, spleen, kidneys, muscle and skin. Molecular testing and sequencing detected Plasmodium spp. and BAGV in different tissues of the partridges, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence and colocalization of both pathogens in the liver and spleen. Due to the importance of the red-legged partridge in the ecosystem of the Iberian Peninsula and as driver of regional economy such mortalities are of concern. Such outbreaks may reflect climate change related shifts in host, vector and pathogen ecology and interactions that could emerge similarly for other pathogens. © 2022 The Authors.

Most of chimpanzees’ communities studied have a preference for tree species in which they nest. As female mosquitoes are feeding on the blood of their host at nighttime, chimpanzees may prevent being disturbed and bitten by mosquitoes by selecting tree species having properties to repel them. Methods: To test the hypothesis that chimpanzees choose tree species for their aromatic properties, data related to 1,081 nesting trees built between 2017 and 2019 in the Sebitoli community of Kibale National Park (Uganda) were analysed. The 10 most used trees were compared to the 10 most common trees in the habitat that were not preferred for nesting. Leaves from the 20 trees species were collected and hydro-distillated to obtain essential oils and one of the by-products for behavioural bioassays against females of the African mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Results: Sebitoli chimpanzees showed tree preferences: 10 species correspond to more than 80% of the nesting trees. Out of the essential oil obtained from the 10 nesting trees, 7 extracts for at least one concentration tested showed spatial repellency, 7 were irritant by contact and none were toxic. In the other hand, for the abundant trees in their habitat not used by chimpanzees, only 3 were repellent and 5 irritants. Discussion and conclusion: This study contributes to evidence that chimpanzees, to avoid annoying mosquitoes, may select their nesting trees according to their repellent properties (linked to chemical parameters), a potential inspiration for human health. © 2022, The Author(s).",1,SD,excluded,Not birds

Herein, inspired by the nesting behavior when fishing, we designed reusable starch sponge with chemically anchored nano-ZnO into carboxylated starch matrix by thermoplastic interfacial reactions and solvent replacement for absorbing and photodegrading methylene blue (MB) in situ. The plasticization and interfacial reactions promoted a simultaneous increase in the reactivity of the starch hydroxyl/carboxyl groups and the specific surface area of ZnO. Meanwhile, the crosslinked networks of starch sponge could be adjusted by varying the ZnO and carboxylic groups contents. The results of photodegradation experiments revealed the recyclable closed-loop process of attraction-trapping-photodegradation of MB was successfully realized, achieving the effect of killing three birds with one stone. The reusable starch sponge with homogeneous dispersion of nano-ZnO by constructing three-dimensional porous channels possessed the high enrichment capacity and the remarkable photocatalysis efficiency with 150 mg/L ZnO. Under UV irradiation, the starch sponge degraded 97 % of MB with 1.67 × 10−3 min−1 photodegradation rate constant even after five cycles, which exceeded most existing photocatalytic systems. Overall, the reusable starch sponge with adjustable structure provided new insights for multifunctional bio-based photocatalyst loading systems. © 2023",1,SD,excluded,Out of field

Combining multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches, we identified the presence of stem cells in the adult DRG satellite glial population, and progenitors were present in the DRGs and sciatic nerve. Cell-specific transgenic mouse lines highlighted the proliferative potential of DRG stem cells and progenitors in vitro. DRG stem cells had gliogenic and neurogenic potentials, whereas progenitors were essentially gliogenic. Lineage tracing showed that, under physiological conditions, adult DRG stem cells maintained DRG homeostasis by supplying satellite glia. Under pathological conditions, adult DRG stem cells replaced DRG neurons lost to injury in addition of renewing the satellite glial pool.

Here, we investigated the potential role that gulls play in the dispersal of plants in Barcelona, a highly populated city of north-eastern Spain. We analysed the stomach contents of 145 chicks collected in urban nests and reported the presence of seeds of 27 plant taxa. We then developed a plant dispersal model based on the movements of 20 GPS-tracked yellow-legged gulls breeding in the city of Barcelona. We estimated seed dispersal distances, seed shadows and percentage of seeds reaching habitats suitable for seeds regurgitated in pellets and those excreted in faeces. Seven of the 27 plant taxa found in the stomachs were alien taxa to Spain. Average dispersal distances of plant seeds by gulls were around 700 m, but maximum dispersal distances reached up to 35 km. Dispersal distances and seed spatial patterns did not differ between faeces and pellet models, as most strongly depended on gull movements. About 95% of the seeds were dispersed within urban environments and between 20 and 30% reached suitable habitats for seed deposition (urban woodlands, green urban parks and urban grasslands). Urban gulls frequently dispersed seeds (including alien species) within urban habitats, both via direct consumption or via secondary dispersal after consuming granivorous birds that had ingested the seeds, such as pigeons or parakeets. Urban planning for Barcelona is based on native plant species, and thus, special attention should be paid to alien plants dispersed by birds, which could pose a risk to native biodiversity in urban ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors",1,SD,excluded,No green nest material

Previous studies have demonstrated that the CX3CR1 receptor plays a crucial role in maintaining an early protective microenvironment after stroke, but whether it persistently influences cognitive dysfunction in the chronic phase requires further investigation. Methods: Mouse was used to establish a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion model to study PSCI. Cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object recognition test. Neurogenesis was assessed by immunofluorescence staining with Nestin+/Ki67+ and DCX+/BrdU+ double-positive cells. The cerebral damage was monitored by [18F]-DPA-714 positron emission tomography, Nissel, and TTC staining. The pyroptosis was histologically, biochemically, and electron microscopically examined. Results: Upon MCAO, at 28 to 35 days, CX3CR1 knockout (CX3CR1−/−) mice had better cognitive behavioral performance both in MWM and novel object recognition test than their CX3CR1+/− counterparts. Upon MCAO, at 7 days, CX3CR1−/− mice increased the numbers of Nestin+/Ki67+ and DCX+/BrdU+ cells, and meanwhile it decreased the protein expression of GSDMD, NLRP3 inflammasome subunit, caspase-1, mature IL-1β/IL-18, and p-P65 in the hippocampus as compared with CX3CR1+/− mice. In addition, CX3CR1−/− mice could reverse infarct volume in the hippocampus region post-stroke. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that CX3CR1 gene deletion was beneficial to PSCI recovery. The mechanism might lie in inhibited pyroptosis and enhanced neurogenesis. CX3CR1 receptor may serve as a therapeutic target for improving the PSCI. © 2023 The Authors.

Here, we obtained well-characterized DANs from hESCs and transplanted them into two parkinsonian monkeys to assess their behavioral and imaging changes. DANs from hESCs expressed dopaminergic markers, generated action potentials, and released dopamine (DA) in vitro. These neurons were transplanted bilaterally into the putamen of parkinsonian NHPs, and using magnetic resonance imaging techniques, we calculated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), both employed for the first time for these purposes, to detect in vivo axonal and cellular density changes in the brain. Likewise, positron-emission tomography scans were performed to evaluate grafted DANs. Histological analyses identified grafted DANs, which were quantified stereologically. After grafting, animals showed signs of partially improved motor behavior in some of the HALLWAY motor tasks. Improvement in motor evaluations was inversely correlated with increases in bilateral FA. MD did not correlate with behavior but presented a negative correlation with FA. We also found higher 11C-DTBZ binding in positron-emission tomography scans associated with grafts. Higher DA levels measured by microdialysis after stimulation with a high-potassium solution or amphetamine were present in grafted animals after ten months, which has not been previously reported. Postmortem analysis of NHP brains showed that transplanted DANs survived in the putamen long-term, without developing tumors, in immunosuppressed animals. Although these results need to be confirmed with larger groups of NHPs, our molecular, behavioral, biochemical, and imaging findings support the integration and survival of human DANs in this pre-clinical PD model. © 2023 by the authors.",1,SD,excluded,Out of field

MicroRNA-124 has been regarded as a promising therapeutic entity for Parkinson's disease due to its pro-neurogenic and neuroprotective roles. However, its efficient delivery to the brain remains challenging. Here, we used umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell-derived extracellular vesicles as a biological vehicle to deliver microRNA (miR)-124-3p and evaluate its therapeutic effects in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. In vitro, miR-124-3p-loaded small extracellular vesicles induced neuronal differentiation in subventricular zone neural stem cell cultures and protected N27 dopaminergic cells against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicity. In vivo, intracerebroventricularly administered small extracellular vesicles were detected in the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricles and in the striatum and substantia nigra, the brain regions most affected by the disease. Most importantly, although miR-124-3p-loaded small extracellular vesicles did not increase the number of new neurons in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned striatum, the formulation protected dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatal fibers, which fully counteracted motor behavior symptoms.

To overcome these hurdles, we engineered a nanoconstruct composed of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP)-indocyanine green that is cloaked self-assembled with tannic acid (termed as indocyanine green-based glow nanoparticles probe, ICG-Glow NPs) for the cancer cell/tissue-specific targeting. The self-assembled ICG-Glow NPs were confirmed by spherical nanoparticles formation (DLS and TEM) and spectral analyses. The NIRF imaging characteristic of ICG-Glow NPs was established by superior fluorescence counts on filter paper and chicken tissue. The ICG-Glow NPs exhibited excellent hemo and cellular compatibility with human red blood cells, kidney normal, pancreatic normal, and other cancer cell lines. An enhanced cancer-specific NIRF binding and imaging capability of ICG-Glow NPs was confirmed using different human cancer cell lines and human tumor tissues. Additionally, tumor-specific binding/accumulation of ICG-Glow NPs was confirmed in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. Collectively, these findings suggest that ICG-Glow NPs have great potential as a novel and safe NIRF imaging probe for cancer cell/tumor imaging.

The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the ‘ant-pollination syndrome’ including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",1,SD,excluded,Not birds

(2) In the ANA + cells group, the GFP signals were observed by in vivo imaging system for small animals within 8 weeks, and GFP-labeled EPI–NCSC–SCLCs were detected in the tissue slices at 16 weeks postoperatively. (3) The facial symmetry at rest after surgery in the ANA + cells group was better than that in the ANA group (p < 0.05), and similar to that in the autograft group (p > 0.05). The initial recovery time of vibrissal and eyelid movement in the ANA group was 2 weeks later than that in the other two groups. (4) The myelinated fibers, myelin sheath thickness and diameter of the axons of the buccal branches in the ANA group were significantly worse than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05), and the results in the ANA + cells group were similar to those in the autograft group (p > 0.05). Conclusions: EPI–NCSC–SCLCs could promote functional and morphological recovery of rat facial nerve defects, and GFP labeling could track the transplanted EPI–NCSC–SCLCs in vivo for a certain period of time. These may provide a novel choice for clinical treatment of peripheral nerve defects. © 2024 The Authors",1,SD,excluded,Out of field
GNM_050_rep,ref_44,Detectability and predator strategy affect egg depredation rates: Implications for mitigating nest depredation in farmlands,Bravo C.; Sarasa M.; Bretagnolle V.; Pays O.,Science of the Total Environment,829,,-,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154558,"Predation is a major evolutionary force in animal ecology. Mechanisms by which prey coloration provides camouflage has been widely studied. However, predator response to prey camouflage and concealment has received less attention. Understanding vegetation structure effect on depredation success could help managers design strategies to mitigate the depredation of managed species (e.g., threatened or hunted). We aimed to investigate the relationship between depredation rate, nest camouflage and concealment in ground-nesting birds of farmlands, and their predators. We set up an experiment of 2576 artificial ground nests to assess the role of egg coloration (white, light green, and dark green), egg size (small, medium, and large), and vegetation structure (vegetation height and land use) in nest survival rates. We also explored the role of predator searching strategies by analysing clumped depredation and multiple depredation events. Of the nests, 34.0% were depredated, with corvids as the predators 78.5% of the time. Corvid depredation decreased by 40–60% in grasslands and spring crops above a vegetation height of 30 cm. In contrast, vegetation height and land use may be of far less importance in avoiding depredation by other predators. The probability of depredation was spatially clumped, suggesting that predators increase search effort in areas where a nest was previously encountered. Neighboring depredation and depredation repetition were more frequent in corvids than in other predators. Our study indicates that nests in vegetation higher than 30 cm had a drastic reduction in depredation rates by corvids. Management of vegetation structure is a key tool to mitigate depredation risk, and improving the availability of alternative food resources may be a complementary tool. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",1,SD,excluded,No green nest material
GNM_051_rep,ref_46,Mapping atrazine persistence in soils of central Argentina using INLA,Giannini-Kurina F.; Borello J.; Cañas I.; Hang S.; Balzarini M.,Soil and Tillage Research,219,,-,2022,10.1016/j.still.2022.105320,"The length of time an herbicide remains in soils can be used as an indicator for diffuse pollution assessment. Atrazine, a residual herbicide with a wide range of reported environmental impacts, has been extensively applied in agricultural soils cultivated with gramineous crops. While atrazine persistence in soils has been widely studied by quantifying half-life from experimental dissipation curves, the spatial variability of half-life at the landscape scale has not been sufficiently explored. The objectives of this work were to estimate atrazine dissipation in a variety of soils and to map its spatial variability by modelling half-life as a function of environmental variables. Based on laboratory determination and environmental data, atrazine dissipation in soils was mapped across the territory of Córdoba province, central Argentina. First, we determined the dissipation parameters of atrazine under a variety of environmental conditions in 60 sites. Second, we fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model for the estimated atrazine half-lives, considering a soil site-specific property (soil organic carbon, SOC) and land use (gramineous crop, non-gramineous crop, pasture, and forest) as covariates. We used Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and stochastic partial differential equations to model the spatial dependence on random effects. The results suggest that atrazine half-life can be spatially predicted by SOC and land use. Atrazine dissipation was faster in sites with previous gramineous crops and high soil organic matter. The digital map allowed us to quantify the environmental variability of atrazine dissipation in Córdoba (3.2–99.5 days). The modelling strategy might be applied to other herbicide compounds by selecting proper environmental covariates. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",1,SD,excluded,No birds
GNM_052_rep,ref_47,On the sparrowhawk-like calls of female common cuckoos: testing for heterospecific vocal mimicry in a conspecific functional context,Moskát C.; Hauber M.E.,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,77,10,-,2023,10.1007/s00265-023-03388-6,"Abstract: Mimicry is a widespread phenomenon whereby predatory or parasitic individuals can access unsuspecting prey or hosts for the former’s benefit. For example, brood parasitic common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) evolved several adaptations to trick hosts, including host-mimetic eggs, a barred chest plumage resembling the predatory Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and the female cuckoos’ bubbling calls considered as highly similar to this raptor’s calls. The sparrowhawk-like call mimicry is thought to threaten hosts while female cuckoos lay their eggs, although the similarity is restricted to the call’s fundamental frequency and not to its harmonics. However, these calls are also used in conspecific contexts, for example for mate attraction. If vocal mimicry is highly adapted toward the heterospecific function, it might cause reduced effectiveness in conspecific communication. We played cuckoo bubbling and sparrowhawk calls to territorial male cuckoos to test whether conspecific receivers process the mimetic calls accurately. All male cuckoos approached the speaker when female cuckoo calls were played, but rarely (7%) approached it when sparrowhawk or green woodpecker (Picus viridis; control) calls were played. When we excised the harmonic overtones from the sparrowhawk stimulus files, making these calls structurally more similar to the pure-tone female cuckoo calls, nearly half (43%) of the cuckoo males approached the speaker. Consequently, the difference in calls’ harmonic structure may explain one component of the inaccurate state of this acoustic mimicry. This imperfect mimicry by female cuckoos’ bubbling call to sparrowhawk call may ensure the multipurpose functions of this vocalization, including both intra- and interspecific contexts. Significance statement: Common cuckoos are obligate brood parasites, laying their eggs into other species’ nests. During laying, female cuckoos utter sparrowhawk-like vocalizations (bubbling calls), to threaten hosts and to evade their defenses. However, they also use this same call to communicate with other female and male cuckoos. If the bubbling call mimics closely sparrowhawks’ calls, cuckoos may also recognize and respond to the sparrowhawk call, the call of a predator, as a cuckoo call. We used playback experiments to show that cuckoos distinguished between bubbling and sparrowhawk calls in nearly all cases. When we manipulated sparrowhawk calls to be more similar acoustically to bubbling calls by deleting overtones, recognition errors increased from 7 to 43%. We conclude that mimicry of sparrowhawk calls by female cuckoo calls is imperfect, which allows it to function in cuckoo-cuckoo communication effectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",1,SD,excluded,No green nest material
GNM_053_rep,ref_48,Cattle grazing in CRP grasslands during the nesting season: effects on avian abundance and diversity,Wilson B.S.; Jensen W.E.; Houseman G.R.; Jameson M.L.; Reichenborn M.M.; Watson D.F.; Morphew A.R.; Kjaer E.L.,Journal of Wildlife Management,86,2,-,2022,10.1002/jwmg.22188,"The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a primary tool for restoring grassland in the United States, in part as wildlife habitat, which has benefited declining grassland bird populations. Among potential mid-contract management practices used to maintain early-successional CRP grasslands, cattle grazing had been prohibited and is currently disincentivized during the primary nesting season for birds (much of the growing season), despite the important role that large herbivores historically played in structuring grassland ecosystems. Conservative grazing of CRP grasslands could increase spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure and plant diversity, potentially supporting higher densities of some grassland bird species and higher bird diversity. Our objective was to determine the effect of experimental cattle grazing on species-specific relative abundance and occupancy, species diversity, and community dissimilarity of grassland birds on CRP grasslands across the longitudinal extent of Kansas, USA (a 63.5-cm precipitation gradient) during the 2017–2019 avian breeding seasons. Fifty-three of 108 fields were grazed by cattle during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 and all fields were rested from grazing in 2019. For all analyses, we examined separate model sets for semiarid western versus more mesic eastern Kansas. Using data from line transect surveys, we modeled relative abundances of 5 songbird species: grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), dickcissel (Spiza americana), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Grazing had delayed yet positive effects on abundances of grasshopper sparrow in western Kansas, and eastern meadowlark in eastern Kansas, but negative effects on dickcissel abundance in western Kansas and especially on burned fields in eastern Kansas. Somewhat counterintuitively, brown-headed cowbirds in western Kansas were more abundant on ungrazed versus grazed fields in the years after grazing began. In addition, we modeled multi-season occupancy of 3 gamebird species (ring-necked pheasant [Phasianus colcicus], northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus], mourning dove [Zenaida macroura]) and Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii); grazing did not affect occupancy of these species. In eastern Kansas, species diversity was highest in grazed, unburned fields. In western Kansas, bird communities in grazed and ungrazed fields were dissimilar, as determined from multivariate analysis. Though regionally variable, conservative stocking of cattle on CRP grasslands during the nesting season as a mid-contract management tool might increase bird species diversity by restructuring habitat that accommodates a greater variety of species and decreasing abundances of species associated with taller, denser stands of vegetation. © 2022 The Wildlife Society",1,SD,excluded,Not experimental
