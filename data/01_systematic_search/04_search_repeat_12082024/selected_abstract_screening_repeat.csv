Potential explanations include the effects of plants' volatile compounds on parasite reduction (nest protection hypothesis) or direct beneficial effects on nestling condition (drug hypothesis). We used correlative data collected during 2020 and 2021 in a Mediterranean population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as well as experimental data (aromatic nest content manipulation) to assess the effects of aromatic plant use on nestling physiological condition and survival, nest-dwelling ectoparasitic pressure and its relationship with breeding parameters. We found that aromatic plants were disproportionally used in relation to their abundance in the environment and that their use was positively related to egg mass (but only in 2020). Blowflies and facultative parasitic mites were more frequent in nests with aromatics compared to nests without aromatics, but obligatory parasitic mites were less abundant in nests with aromatics. However, no effects of aromatic plants were observed on nestling haemoglobin levels nor erythrocyte sedimentation rate or other physiological health metrics, but the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in nests with the highest quantity of aromatics. The artificial addition of mint reduced the flea abundance, but 7-day old nestlings showed significantly lower colour saturation and brightness in the mouth flange. Nestling survival to fledging was not related to aromatic plant use. Therefore, our results partially support a beneficial effect of aromatic plants in blue tit nests because some ectoparasite groups were reduced. Immediate effects on nestling physiology or survival could not be established. Significance statementSome avian species place fresh aromatic plant material in their nests, and several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain its potential functions. In this study, we use both correlational and experimental data from a blue tit population to test two hypotheses, namely the `nest protection hypothesis' and the `drug hypothesis'. The first one proposes that aromatic plants have direct repellent effects against ectoparasites, while the latter poses that these plant components benefit nestling condition through the stimulation of some components of the immune system. Our results suggest that some ectoparasites, such as fleas and obligatory parasitic mites, were less abundant in nests where aromatic plants were artificially or naturally added, respectively, but no relationships were detected with nestling physiology or survival, which could be partially explained by our small sample size. Our study partially supports a beneficial effect of aromatic plants in avian nests.",1,"SD","selected",NA

This behavior is relatively rare among bird species, and there is ongoing debate about whether it benefits parental breeding success. In this study, we experimentally tested whether the inclusion of aromatic-herbal plant fragments in the nests of great tits Parus major affects the physiological condition of nestlings, as indicated by blood levels of hematocrit, hemoglobin, glucose, and body condition indices, such as weight and wing length. We divided the nests into 2 groups, adding aromatic herbs to the test groupâ€™s nests and non-aromatic plants to the control group. After the nestlings fledged, all nest materials were collected to extract, identify, and count arthropod ectoparasites. Nestlings in nests supplemented with aromatic plant fragments had elevated levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin, indicating improved physiological condition compared to the control group. Ectoparasites were present in both groups, although ticks (Ixodidae) occurred less frequently in nests with aromatic plants. The experimental treatment did not affect fledging success. Further experimental studies are needed to explore the effects of incorporating aromatic plant fragments into tit nests within the frameworks of both the nest protection hypothesis and the drug hypothesis.",NA,NA,NA,NA

In this field study we investigated whether these herbs reduce ectoparasites and thereby protect nestlings (the nest protection hypothesis). We also considered whether volatile compounds in herbs improve the condition of nestlings (the drug hypothesis). As measures of condition we used body mass, haematocrit levels and immunological parameters. We replaced 148 natural Starling nests with artificial ones: half contained-herbs and half (controls) contained grass. The ectoparasite loads (mites, lice, fleas) in herb and control nests were indistinguishable. However, nestlings in herb nests weighed more and had higher haematocrit levels at fledging than nestlings in control nests. Fledging success was similar in herb and control nests, but more yearlings from herb nests were identified iri the colony the year after hatching. The response of:the immune system when challenged with phytohaemagglutinin did not differ in nestlings from herb and control nests. Nestlings from herb nests had-more basophils and fewer lymphocytes in their blood than those from control nests, while the eosinophil and heterophil counts did not differ. We conclude that herbs do not reduce the number of ectoparasites, but they improve the condition of nestlings, perhaps by stimulating elements of the immune system that help them to cope better with the harmful activities of ectoparasites.
