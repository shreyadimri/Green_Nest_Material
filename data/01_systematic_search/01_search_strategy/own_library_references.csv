Parents may, however, trade off catering for embryonic requirements against their own need to forage through intermittent incubation. This dynamically adjusted behaviour can be affected by properties of the nest. Here, we experimentally show a novel mechanism by which parents, through incorporation of aromatic herbs into nests, effectively modify their incubation behaviour to the benefit of their offspring. Our study species, the European starling, includes in its nest aromatic herbs which promote offspring fitness. We provided wild starlings with artificial nests including or excluding the typically selected fresh herbs and found strong support for our prediction of facilitated incubation. Herb effects were not explained by thermal changes of the nests per se, but by modified parental behaviours. Egg temperatures and nest attendance were higher in herb than herbless nests, egg temperatures dropped less frequently below critical thresholds and parents started their active day earlier. These effects were dynamic over time and particularly strong during early incubation. Incubation period was shorter in herb nests, and nestlings were heavier one week after hatching. Aromatic herbs hence influenced incubation in beneficial ways for offspring, possibly through pharmacological effects on incubating parents.","English","1880","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Gwinner, Helga and Capilla-Lasheras, Pablo and Cooper, Caren and Helm, Barbara month = jun,","2018","Place: 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND Publisher: ROYAL SOC Type: Article","egg temperature, European starling, medicinal herbs, prenatal, timing, volatile",NA

They can modify the bacterial and parasitic environment of the nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual signalling processes. In spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, green plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored these effects in two different populations, together with the potential effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres. Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of staphylococci on the skin of 8-day-old nestlings was negatively related to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these experimental effects. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Why some birds add green plants to their nests has long puzzled biologists. Some studies suggest that this behavior is promoted by natural selection because of its positive effects on nestling health. However, if greenery functions as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness, it may promote costly female competition for preferred males. We experimentally increased the amount of plants in spotless starling's nests, causing a reduction in the number of recruits. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses, adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and recruitment success.","English","4","BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY","Polo, Vicente and Rubalcaba, Juan G. and Veiga, Jose P. month = aug,","2015","Place: JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC Type: Article","sexual selection, courtship display, green plants carrying, male ornaments, natural selection, recruitment rate, Sturnus unicolor","1131--1137"
"4","article","Nest size and aromatic plants in the nest as sexually selected female traits in blue tits","24","1045-2249","10.1093/beheco/art015","Besides the direct functionality of nests driven by natural selection, accumulating evidence shows that nest building behaviors and nests may also evolve under sexual selection. Empirical research on the potential role of nests or nest features as sexual signals, however, is comparatively scarce for avian species in which the female is the only sex involved in its construction because of a male bias in the study of sexual traits, even though maternally built nests may be more common than paternally and biparentally built nests. In blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, females alone build nests and add aromatic plants to them. We manipulated nest size and amount of aromatic plants in the nest to assess subsequent male effort and risk taking during provisioning of nestlings as indices of differential allocation. Risk taking was assessed through trappability indices of males at the nest-box when provisioning nestlings. Although male provisioning rates did not differ between experimental groups, male risk taking during provisioning was significantly lower in nests reduced in size than in control and enlarged nests, and it was significantly higher in nests supplied with aromatic plants than in control nests. Females showed nonsignificant trends to increase their provisioning effort in reduced nests, probably to compensate reduced male investment. Finally, female provisioning rates and especially male risk taking had a major positive impact on reproductive success and thereby on female fitness. In summary, this study (and previous evidence) suggests that nest size and aromatic plants in blue tit nests are used by females as sexual signals to elicit differential allocation in males. This study adds to the scarce evidence in favor of nests or nest materials acting as sexually selected traits regarding female signaling.","English","4","BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY","Tomas, Gustavo and Merino, Santiago and Martinez-de la Puente, Josue and Moreno, Juan and Morales, Judith and Rivero-de Aguilar, Juan month = aug,","2013","Place: JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC Type: Article","green plants, differential allocation, extended phenotype, female ornamentation, greenery, nest building, nest size, parental investment, risk taking, trappability","926--934"

The “nest protection hypothesis”, which posits that volatile secondary compounds contained in these plants may have antiparasite properties, has not received full support. All previous tests of this hypothesis have only considered effects on nest-dwelling ectoparasites, but not on blood-sucking flies. The “drug hypothesis” posits that aromatic plants may stimulate nestling immune system, development, or condition. We tested these hypotheses experimentally in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. a species that adds aromatic plants to their nests. We supplemented aromatic plants to half of a sample of nests, while adding grass to the other half of nests. We quantified abundance of two groups of blood-sucking flies (blackflies and biting midges) at two different stages of the reproductive period, and abundance of three nest-dwelling ectoparasites (fleas, mites, and blowflies). Experimental supplementation of aromatic plants reduced abundance of fleas only in nests of yearling females and not in nests of older females. Blackflies and biting midges were both more numerous in nests of yearling females than in nests of older females. Mass of aromatic plants added by females was negatively related with abundance of fleas in control nests but not in experimental nests supplied with aromatic plants. Mass of plants added by females was also positively related with abundance of blackflies during the nestling stage. Finally, aromatic plants did not affect nestling growth or immune responses. We conclude that several factors such as female experience and their ability to add plants to the nest interact to explain effects of aromatic plants on different parasites. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Spotless starling males (Sturnus unicolor) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male-biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female-female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male-biased sex ratios and female resource-holding potential in intra-sexual competition in this species.","English","2","ETHOLOGY","Polo, Vicente and Lopez-Rull, Isabel and Gil, Diego and Veiga, Jose P. month = feb,","2010","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY-BLACKWELL Type: Article",NA,"129--137"

It has been suggested, although never tested, that birds use fresh plants to limit the growth of nest microorganisms. On Corsica, blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) incorporate fresh fragments of aromatic plants into their nests. These plants do not reduce infestation by nest ectoparasites, but have been shown to improve growth and condition of chicks at fledging. To understand the mechanisms underlying such benefits, we experimentally tested the effects of these plants on the bacteria living on blue tits. Aromatic plants significantly affected the structure of bacterial communities, in particular reducing bacterial richness on nestlings. In addition, in this population where there is a strong association between bacterial density and infestation by blood-sucking Protocalliphora blow fly larvae, these plants reduced bacterial density on the most infested chicks. Aromatic plants had no significant effect on the bacteria living on adult blue tits. This study provides the first evidence that fresh plants brought to the nests by adult birds limit bacterial richness and density on their chicks.","English","4","OECOLOGIA","Mennerat, Adele and Mirleau, Pascal and Blondel, Jacques and Perret, Philippe and Lambrechts, Marcel M. and Heeb, Philipp month = oct,","2009","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Aromatic plants, Bacterial communities, Cyanistes caeruleus, Nest greenery, Protocalliphora sp.","849--855"

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration.","English","3","JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY","Lopez-Rull, Isabel and Gil, Diego month = may,","2009","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,"254--262"

Few studies have explored nest building and maintenance from this perspective, although the nest is the first environment experienced by hatchlings. On Corsica, blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, incorporate fresh fragments of several species of aromatic plants in the nest cup throughout the nesting period, and replenish the nest with fresh fragments of the same plant species quickly after experimental removal. In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants used by blue tits affect the growth and condition of nestlings. Because we expected the effects of plants to depend on environmental conditions, we tested this hypothesis both in enlarged and in control broods. Aromatic plants positively affected chick mass gain in enlarged broods. Chicks in nests containing aromatic plants also had higher haematocrit levels. In addition, in 1 of the 2 study years, feathers developed faster in aromatic-treated nests than in nests where aromatic plants had been replaced by a neutral nest material (moss). However, no significant effect of aromatic plants on chick body size at. edging was found.

In Corsica, recent findings suggest that cavity-nesting blue tits may use volatile compounds in the context of nest building and maintenance. Although they build their nests mainly from moss, female blue tits also frequently incorporate fragments of several species of aromatic plants in the nest cup. In field experiments, breeding female blue tits altered their nest maintenance behaviour in response to experimental addition of aromatic plants in their nest. In aviary experiments. captive male blue tits could be trained to detect lavender odour from a distance. Here I report results from a field study aimed to test whether adult blue tits altered their chick-feeding behaviour after an experimental change in nest odour composition. I experimentally added fragments of aromatic plant species that differed from those brought in the nests before the start of the experiment in a set of experimental nests and added moss, the basic nest material, in a set of control nests. Both male and female blue tits hesitated significantly longer entering the nest cavity after addition of new aromatic plant fragments, as compared to moss addition. This response was especially observed during the first visit following the experimental change in nest plant composition. Nest composition treatment had no effect on the time spent in the nest.

In this field study on another cavity-nester, tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, we tested whether yarrow reduced ectoparasite loads (the nest protection hypothesis), stimulated nestling immune systems (the drug hypothesis), or had other consequences for nestling growth or parental reproductive success (predicted by both preceding hypotheses). Tree swallows do not naturally add greenery to their nests, and thus offer several advantages in testing for effects of greenery independent of other potentially confounding explanations for the behaviour. We placed fresh yarrow in 23 swallow nests on the day the first egg was laid, replenishing every two days until clutch completion (=three times), and at 44 control nests, nesting material was simply touched. At 12 days of age, we measured nestling body size and mass, and took blood smears to do differential white blood cell counts. We subsequently determined the number and proportion of young fledging from nests and the number of fleas remaining after fledging. Higher humidity was associated with higher flea numbers whereas number of feathers in the nest was not. Our most significant finding was that an average of 773 fleas Ceratophyllus idius was found in control nests, versus 419 in yarrow nests. Possibly, parents compensate for blood that nestlings lose to ectoparasites by increasing food delivery, because we detected no differences between treatments in nestling mass, nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion of young fledging, or relative to flea numbers. Our results provide no support for the drug hypothesis and strong support for the nest protection hypothesis.","English","1","JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY","Shutler, Dave and Campbell, Adam A. month = jan,","2007","Place: 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: BLACKWELL PUBLISHING Type: Article",NA,"7--12"

In a field study, we investigated whether these herbs affect the mite and bacteria load of the nests and the condition of the nestlings either directly or via parasite control. We examined the amount of herbs and the number of plant species males carried into their nests, the variation of volatile compounds in the headspace air of the nest boxes and mite/bacteria load of the nests throughout the season. The amount of herb material and the number of plant species, the number of substances emanated by these plants and the infestation of the nests with bacteria and mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) increased with season. In a field experiment, we exchanged natural starling nests with experimental nests with or without herbs. We found that the herbs had no effect on the mites but fewer bacteria were sampled in nests with herbs than in nests without herbs. The body mass of the fledging was not related to the season or the mite/bacteria load of the nests. However, nestlings from nests with herbs fledged with higher body mass than nestlings from nests without herbs. Both bacteria and mite load were related to nestling mortality. In nests containing no herbs, the numbers of fledglings declined significantly with the increasing mite load while the mites had no effect on the number of fledglings in nests with herbs. Thus, the nest herbs counteracted the effect of the mites. In conclusion, it seems that volatile herbs can reduce bacterial but not mite infestation of the starling nests. The positive influence of herbs on nestling growth indicates that herbs either directly (perhaps as immunostimulants) improve the condition of the nestlings and help them cope with the harmful effects of mites, or they provide a nest environment beneficial for the nestlings' development by the reduction of germs.","English","4","JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY","Gwinner, H and Berger, S month = oct,","2005","Place: 233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","European starlings, herbs, nestlings condition, parasites, season","365--371"

The adaptive significance of this behaviour, however, is unclear. The “nest protection hypothesis” suggests that volatile chemicals contained in green plants reduce populations of nest-dwelling ectoparasites. I tested this hypothesis with tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor (Vieillot, 1808), a species that has large infestations of ectoparasites in its nests. I experimentally added green leaves of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) to nests and compared these nests to control nests. My results showed that nests with yarrow had significantly higher levels of infestation by fleas, and yarrow had no effect on the number of blow flies detected. There was no effect of yarrow on condition of parents, size of offspring, or the probability of nests fledging at least one young. I did, however, find that second-year (SY) females with yarrow added to their nests hatched significantly more eggs than control SY females. In addition, pairs with yarrow added to their nest were significantly less likely to suffer hatching failure and (or) brood reduction. These beneficial effects of yarrow cannot be explained by reductions in numbers of fleas or blow flies, and I suggest that these results may be due to reductions in numbers of other types of parasites not quantified in my study, such as flying insects or the diseases that they may vector. I discuss my findings for swallows in the context of results from previous studies of other species that habitually use green plant material such as yarrow in their nests.","English","7","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE","Dawson, RD month = jul,","2004","Place: RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA Publisher: NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA Type: Article",NA,"1005--1010"
