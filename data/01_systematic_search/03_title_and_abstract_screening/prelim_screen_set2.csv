Distinct subcolony groups were recognized within the colony. During incubation, attendance at the colony increased to a peak between 2100 and 2400 h, with large rafts building up on the sea before engaging in aerial flights and then settling on land. During the nestling period, this pattern changed with further peaks at 0600 and 1800 h, and a decline during the afternoon, particularly during the late nestling period. Little Auks fed exclusively on copepods and amphipods (94%Calanus finmarchicus) usually captured within 2.5 km of the colony. Feeding rhythms fitted closely the known diurnal vertical migrations of Calanus with peaks between 2200 and 0800 h. Some individuals within subcolony groups showed synchrony of feeds, mainly between 1800 and 2400 h. The mean number of feeds to a chick in 24 h was 5.25. Growth rates of young were comparable between all four experimental groups and controls, although the latter attained higher weights. Mean daily weight increases were constant until 18 days of age when they declined sharply. This was not reflected in a change in mean daily weight increases with date and so suggests that food availability had not declined. Instead there was a reduced feeding rate to chicks from age 21 days to fledging. Breeding success was 50 %, mainly the result of egg desertion and predation by Arctic Foxes, and this may have been reduced by our own activities. Behaviour postures and the responses they elicited are described together with the diurnal patterns of different activities. Aerial flights are also described and their possible function discussed. It is concluded that the shortness of the time when abundant food is available has encouraged close breeding synchrony and this is achieved by mass flights and rafting on the sea beside the colony, and subdivision of the colony into groups with communal behaviour close to the nests.

The standard assumed value used for absorptance is 0.84 (leaf absorptance factor, Abt(F)). We described a reflectance-absorptancetransmittance (RAT) meter for routine experimental measurements of the actual absorptance of leaves. The RAT uses a red-green-blue (RGB) LED diode light source to measure absorptances at wavelengths suitable for use with PAM fluorometers and infrared gas analysers. Results using the RAT were compared to spectra using a Taylor integrating sphere on bird's nest fern (Asplenium nidus), banana, Doryanthes excelsa, Kalanchoe daigremontiana, and sugarcane. Parallel venation had no significant effect upon Abt(465) in banana, Doryanthes, a Dendrobium orchid, pineapple, and sugarcane, but there was a slight difference in the case of the fern A. nidus. The average Abt(465) (a parts per thousand 0.96) and Abt(625) (a parts per thousand 0.89) were a parts per thousand 14\% and 6\% higher than the standard value (Abt(F) = 0.84). The PAR-range Abt(400-700) was only a parts per thousand 5\% higher than the standard value (a parts per thousand 0.88) based on averaged absorptance from the blue, green, and red light data and from where the RGB-diode was used as a `white' light source. In some species, absorptances at blue and red wavelengths are quite different (e.g. water lily). Reflectance measurements of leaves using the RAT would also be useful for remote sensing studies.",89,2

It was the summer in 1965 while conducting my doctoral dissertation research at the University of Georgia (UGA). My dissertation research was the first major investigation conducted at HorseShoe Bend (HSB) Experimental Site located in Clarke County, latitude 33Â°57â€²N and longitude 83Â°23â€²W, near Athens, Georgia. HSB is a 35-acre (14.1-ha) research site created by a meander of the North Oconee River (see Barrett 1968, Blesh and Williams 2003, Hendrix 1997 for detailed descriptions of the site). This ecosystem-level investigation focused on the effects of a carbamate insecticide (Sevin) on small mammal populations in semi-enclosed grassland ecosystems later published in Ecology (Barrett 1968). At HSB, the undergrowth outside of the 0.4-ha enclosures and along the North Oconee River contained an abundance of Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), and greenbrier (Smilax sp.) within a bottomland forest community. One afternoon during the 1960s, while hiking through this mixed hardwood and thicket-type plant community, I came upon a globular nest. I had never seen a nest like this during my childhood while living on a farm in southern Indiana. I assumed it was a bird nest of which I was not yet familiar. Out of curiosity, I touched the nest with a stick and out from the nest appeared the most beautiful small mammal that I had ever observed. This docile animal stopped on a limb in the sun to groom. Its rich golden pelage remains vivid in my mind to this day. I returned to the nest site the next day with a pair of long forceps to live capture (by its tail) and identify this beautiful small mammal species. I found it interesting to observe a small mammal residing in bushes, rather than in open fields, such as the deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that I had livetrapped in a red clover (Trifolium pratense) field while conducting research for my Master's thesis at Marquette University (Barrett and Darnell 1967). This individual was identified as a golden mouse and that experience, unrelated to my dissertation research at the time, was my initial introduction to O. nuttalli. It was also at that time that I read an article in the March-April issue of Audubon Magazine entitled Search for the Golden Mouse (Terres 1966), which intrigued me. These circumstances served as an early incentive for a continuing interest that would result many years later in this book. Â© 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.",291,1

Concomitant investigations of MFO activity were conducted in starlings exposed to DMBA. Ethoxyresorufin Oâ€�dealkylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin Oâ€�depentylase (PROD) were used as indicators of hepatic MFO activity. Changes in MFO activity were compared to chemically altered immune responses following DMBA exposure. Subcutaneous exposure of adult starlings to 125 mg/kg DMBA resulted in suppression of lymphocyte blastogenesis and antibody production to SRBC. EROD and PROD activity were increased 2.8â€� and 3.4â€�fold, respectively. Lymphocyte blastogenesis was impaired in adult starlings orally exposed to 125 mg/kg DMBA. The immune system of nestling starlings exposed orally to 100 mg/kg DMBA was altered, as evidenced by decreased phagocytic ability of macrophages and inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Oral exposure to DMBA did not induce MFO activity in starlings of either age class. Effects of DMBA on immune function and MFO activity in starlings varied with the age of birds and route and length of chemical exposure. Copyright Â© 1994 SETAC",344,1

The natural living-space of wildlife is shrinking due to human activities. 70% of the hunting areas are cultivated today. The majority of wild animals is squeezed into the plough-lands, where they are threatened not only by harvesters and mowers, but also by the adverse effects of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. The experiment was aimed at modelling the effects of NIKROL - UAN solution on chick embryos. In alfalfa-fields different solutions of NIKROL are used for manuring: concentrated solution for basic fertilization, 50% solution for mulching and 20% solution for foliar fertilization. The time of foliar fertilization coincides with the egg-laying and hatching period of pheasants and partridges, thus endangering the reproductive success of these species. In the experiment the effects of different NIKROL - UAN solutions (concentrated, 50%, 20%, 1%) on embryonic development were determined. Main results: Concentrated, 50% and 20% solutions of NIKROL injected into the eggs caused 87-96% embryonic mortality right after treatment. Embryomortality slightly decreased (27-80%) when eggs,.were immersed in the solutions, but still was dose-dependent. 29 different morphological deformities were detected of which the most frequent ones were stunted growth (16%) and cyst over the embryo (14%). Statistical analysis showed that in the second 5 days of incubation NICROL did not influence the weight gain of living embryos when eggs were immersed in the solutions. NIKROL - UAN solution proved to be dangerous to small games nestling in alfalfa- and winter-cereal fields. This fact calls for the extention of research on the postembryonic development of birds, and other animal species (deer, rabbit, etc.). Neglecting fertilization is inconceivable these days, but the application of fertilizers should be carried out with circumspection. In order to protect birds foliar fertilization should be completed at a time not coinciding with the egg-laying and hatching period. The protection of other animal species accounts for the reduction of the amount of fertilizer applied. Nowadays there are numerous biological methods for nutrient supply and yield-increase (green manure, compost, bacterial inoculation of soil, etc.). Â© 1999, Blackwell Wissenschafts-Verlag.",329,2

Thyroxine levels did not increase until 6 days after dosing and they remained elevated after 2 weeks.

Knowledge of their nutrition is important for understanding their survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate husbandry under human care. Hand-rearing is a common practice for psittacines, however research on their nutrition is limited. We analysed the predicted metabolisable energy, crude protein, crude fat, minerals and the essential amino acid profiles of the crop contents from free-living nestlings of scarlet macaws (Ara macao) and red-and-green macaws (Ara chloropterus) from southeastern Peru, Cuban Amazons (Amazona leucocephala bahamensis) from the Bahamas, lilac-crowned Amazons (Amazona finschi) from northwestern Mexico and thick-billed parrots (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) from northern Mexico. The crop content of the different parrot species displayed remarkably similar nutritional profiles, considering their diversity in habitats, geographic ranges and food sources. The crude protein and crude fat concentrations in crop samples were particularly similar for the Ara and Amazona species, while the thick-billed parrot stood out for its higher crude fat and lower crude protein content. Wider variations were found among the concentrations of sodium (Na) and iron (Fe), proline and tryptophan. Compared with the requirements of 6-12 weeks leghorn chickens, all free-ranging parrot diets contained lower crude protein, calcium (Ca), potassium (P) and Na concentrations. The hand-feeding formulas contained lower crude fat, magnesium (Mg), arginine, valine and phenylalanine concentrations, as well as much higher levels of Ca and zinc (Zn), in comparison with parrot crop samples. Our data suggest that a single formulation could be used to hand-rear Ara and Amazona sp. of 3 weeks of age and older, while a different formulation would likely be more appropriated for Rhynchopsitta sp. Experimental studies should evaluate if increasing the concentration of crude fat, Mg, arginine, valine and phenylalanine enhances psittacine chick growth and health.",42,2

The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of the methods used to manage and control the feral pigeon population in Ljubljana. The effectiveness of progesterone, ultrasound deterrent and artificial dovecots for egg collection was tested in order to evaluate different approaches to feral pigeon population management in Ljubljana. The most effective method of pigeon control was the use of contraceptives, since the number of pigeons in selected locations of the wider centre of Ljubljana decreased by 49.1\% (P>0.05) in the period from 1999 to 2004. The method of ultrasound as a pigeon deterrent remains questionable, since no distinctive deterrent effects were established, even though pigeons in our experiment showed significant (P<0.001) signs of agitation when ultrasound was present in the tested area of the covered passage entrance to the urban landfill in Ljubljana. The method of pigeon nesting in 8 green plot and 2 house attic artificial dovecots, which we are investigating at present, seems to have great potential regarding the egg collecting and consequently the reduction of the number of feral pigeons, improving nesting hygiene and hobby feeding control. After a 10-month period, since the green plot dovecots were built, pigeons have already started to nest in 62\% of the available nesting space, however eggs will not be collected until the dovecots are populated completely. The house attic dovecotes were only built recently, so they were still un-populated at the end of this study. We concluded that all the methods used may be only successful in the long term by implementing an integrated approach to pigeon control, specially supported by public information and education.",111,1

However, the consequences of this behaviour for the females are still poorly known. In this study, we evaluated the behavioural responses of female Spotless Starlings to the green plants that they find in their nests. We added green plants to a group of experimental nests (E nests) and quantified the activity of the nesting females in the E nests and in a group of non-manipulated nests (C nests). The females never added green plants to their nests, but they removed the green plants more frequently from the E nests than from the C nests. The number of departures from the nest by females that carried green plants was positively correlated with the number of visits by females that carried nothing. In contrast, the number of departures by females carrying green plants was uncorrelated with the number of visits made by females that carried nest-building materials. These results suggest that the females made a specific additional effort to remove the green plants from the E nests. We propose that this behaviour may be an adaptive response of mated females that serves to counteract the eventual negative effects of green plants on their reproductive success. However, competing hypotheses cannot be rejected, and additional work is needed to better understand the removal of green plants by female Spotless Starlings.",20,1

Herbicide followed by seeding of native plants reduces tall fescue and is predicted to restore habitat quality over time, but little is known about short-term (1â€“2Â year) impacts on native species. We conducted a landscape-scale controlled experiment to assess the short-term effects of herbicide and seeding on the reproduction of an obligate grassland bird, the dickcissel (Spiza americana). In 2014, four sites in southern Iowa were each subdivided into three patches (mean 7Â ha). One patch in each site was treated with glyphosate herbicide (spray-only), one with herbicide and native seeding (spray-and-seed), with the third serving as a control. Two sites were grazed by cattle from April to July and two sites were ungrazed. We monitored dickcissel reproduction in 2016, finding that they were more abundant, built more nests, experienced less cowbird parasitism, had increased nest survival, and produced more fledglings on spray-only and spray-and-seed treatments compared to control patches. Dickcissels nested infrequently on grazed sitesâ€”especially grazed control patches. We did not detect any impacts on clutch size, provisioning rates, or nestling mass, but Araneae (spiders) and Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars) may have been smaller on sprayed patches. Positive responses by dickcissels were likely due to successful reduction of tall fescue and improved access to suitable nest sites through increased vegetation heterogeneity. Our results indicate that using herbicide and seeding to restore tall fescue-dominated sites improves habitat quality for this grassland bird, shortly after restoration. Â© 2022 The Authors.

Interphyletic comparisons in mammals suggest that male-biased dispersal occurs in polygynous and promiscuous species where local mate competition among males exceeds local resource competition among females. However, few studies have analysed sex-biased patterns of dispersal at the individual level, and facultatively polygynous species might offer this opportunity. In the spotless starling, polygynous males exhibit their mating status during courtship carrying higher amounts of green plants to nests than monogamous males. We experimentally incorporated green plants to nests during four years to analyse long-term consequences on breeding success and offspring recruitment rates. We unexpectedly found that experimental sons recruited farther than experimental daughters, while control daughters recruited farther than control sons. A similar pattern was found using observational information from eight years. We discuss this result in the context of local competition hypothesis and speculate that sons dispersed farther from nests controlled by polygynous males to avoid competition with relatives. The amount of green plants in nests affects female perception of male attractiveness and degree of polygyny, although little is known about proximate mechanisms linking this process with the offspring dispersal behaviour. Our results support the idea that male-biased dispersal is related to polygyny in a facultatively polygynous bird. Â© 2016 The Authors",70,2

To understand the mechanisms underlying such benefits, we experimentally tested the effects of these plants on the bacteria living on blue tits. Aromatic plants significantly affected the structure of bacterial communities, in particular reducing bacterial richness on nestlings.

This experiment investigated the effect of symmetric and asymmetric arbitrary traits (arrangements of coloured leg-bands) on reproductive success in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Six groups of six males and six females were separated into six free-flight breeding aviaries. Nestboxes and nesting material were freely available throughout the experiment. Males wore symmetric and asymmetric arrangements of the same coloured leg-bands. Each male wore two orange and two light green bands, two on each leg. There were six possible arrangements of these leg-bands. One male from each of these six leg-band treatments was present in each aviary, along with six females wearing numbered orange bands. Symmetrically banded males produced more offspring that survived past the period of parental care than males in either of the asymmetric treatments; this appeared to be the effect of female choice processes and female-based parental investment and not male intra-sexual dominance. This is the first experiment to indicate that symmetrically manipulated males gain reproductive advantages in controlled laboratory conditions and further supports recent theories indicating the evolutionary importance of symmetry in signalling-trait design.

Two identical patches of peanuts were available and were approximately 300 m apart. Prior to treatment, all birds preferred to feed closest to the woodland. We applied cinnamamide (0.6\% mass/mass), an avian repellent, to peanuts in the preferred rows of 1 patch (row 1 nest to the wood iri the first veer of the experiment, and rows 1-3 in the second year). All birds avoided treated peanuts. When row I was treated, the number of tits feeding on rows 2-3 increased, and many of the green finches moved away from the treated patch to the untreated patch. Whem rows 1-3 were treated, a few tits moved Lo feed on row 1, but most birds left the treated patch and numbers increased on the untreated patch, which suggested they flew to the untreated patch. Modifications of feeding behavior brought about by the presence of cinnamamide varied among species. Such modifications may have been related to differences in social organization: tits were relatively solitary feeders and were also probably establishing territories at the time of the experiment (Feb-Mar), whereas greenfinches fed and flew in large flocks. Thus, it wits likely easier for greenfinches to fly between patches than the tits. Only when eating untreated peanuts at their ``local{''} patch involved feeding greater than or equal to 20 m from cover did most tits leave the patch. probably for the untreated patch.

This seemingly conspicuous coloration has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited. In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of other females. We used correlational data and an experimental manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg coloration. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",25,2

The chimpanzees of the Goualougo Triangle are known to have one of the largest and most complex tool repertoires reported for wild chimpanzees. One tool set habitually used by this population includes a perforating tool to penetrate the hard outer crust of elevated termite nests before fishing for termite prey with an herbaceous stem. Here, we report the variation present in the grips used on the perforating tool. Our analysis of video recordings of chimpanzee visitation to termite nests over a 3-year period shows that these chimpanzees use a variety of grips to navigate the challenges encountered in opening a termite nest. For situations in which the soil is most hardened, perforating requires force and a power grip is often used. When the soil in the passageway is loose, precision grips are suitable for the task. One of the preferred grips reported here is an interdigital brace, which has previously been described in studies of how some people hold a pencil. In this study, for the first time, the interdigital brace has been thoroughly described for chimpanzees. The various strategies and grips used during perforation emphasize the importance of termites as a nutritional resource that should be considered more strongly as a food used by early hominins.

Breeding populations of birds in these remote locations may be changing and have garnered much attention regarding their conservation. We analyzed data from bird lists (daily species observations) collected while conducting other targeted research to estimate trends in the probability of observing species at two sub-Arctic study sites. For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species) we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60% of species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional, provincial and national. We hypothesized that trends may be due to climate change effects or because of effects related to intensive herbivory from nesting geese. Trends for most of the species where we made specific predictions from these hypotheses agreed with those predicted; however, well-designed experiments are needed to conclusively determine the driving mechanisms of these trends. Collecting bird list data while simultaneously conducting other research is not nearly as time consuming or expensive as targeted breeding bird surveys (e.g., point counts, call counts, nest searching, etc.). This analysis method may be of utility for other remote field study sites where gaps in trend data exist. Â© 2021 by the author(s). Published here under license by the Resilience Alliance.",197,1

We assessed the costs and benefits of asynchronous hatching in the Greenrumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), a small Neotropical parrot that hatches large clutches very asynchronously. We manipulated eggs to create broods of four, six, or eight young that hatched synchronously or asynchronously. In a second experiment, we tested whether food limits offspring survival by experimentally feeding later hatched young in large asynchronous broods. We also examined the premise that food varies unpredictably by sampling seeds throughout several breeding seasons. Experimentally synchronized broods generally fledged as many or more young than asynchronous broods. Synchrony particularly outperformed asynchrony in broods of eight, where food demands should have been greatest. Nestlings had a higher probability of hedging from synchronous broods than from asynchronous broods, from small rather than medium or large broods, and if they were early hatched rather than later hatched. Most mortality in asynchronous broods occurred within 12 d of hatching, and a significantly greater proportion of later hatched chicks died with empty crops than did early hatched chicks. Later hatched chicks grew more slowly than their earlier hatched nestmates, but at fledging they were as heavy or heavier than earlier hatched chicks. Chicks from asynchronous broods were slightly heavier at hedging than synchronous chicks, but there was no correlation between hedging mass and the likelihood of being resighted in subsequent years. Cormack-Jolly-Seber model estimates revealed no significant differences in annual survival rates between young fledged from synchronous and asynchronous broods. Female chicks hedged from synchronous broods were recruited into the study population at a lower rate than those from asynchronous broods. Older chicks from reduced broods were less likely to hedge than chicks from broods that fledged all their young. Parents of large synchronous and asynchronous broods provisioned their young at similar rates and did not differ significantly in their subsequent survival. Females that raised experimentally synchronous and asynchronous broods showed no significant differences in the likelihood, timing, or success of their next breeding attempt. A marginally higher proportion of last-hatched chicks that received supplemental food survived to fledging than last-hatched control chicks, but feeding had no effect on penultimate chicks. Seed densities showed a high degree of autocorrelation over spans of 30-50 d. Asynchronous hatching appears to result in the mortality of the smallest young, due in part to the inequitable distribution of food among nestmates, rather than to food limitation, and as a direct result of the size disparities among nestmates. Thus, parrotlet parents appeared to derive no detectable short- or long-term benefits from the staggered hatching of their young through increased nestling growth and survival, reduced parental efforts, or increased parental survival. Although other adaptive benefits from hatching asynchrony are possible that were not tested directly in these experiments (e.g., `'insurance'' that some nestlings will survive), they seem insufficient to account for the extreme hatching asynchrony observed in the parrotlet. Instead, benefits to egg survival derived from the early onset of incubation may offset the costs of asynchronous hatching.",39,2

In particular, sex-biased predation is expected to have implications for sexual selection, sex allocation and population dynamics. In this study, we analysed sex differences in the predation of the western green lizard (Lacerta bilineata) by the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) during the reproductive season. In addition, we investigated whether the rate of predation differed during the 8-year study period and among the three habitats studied. We collected lizard remains from nest boxes of kestrels. Freshly killed lizards were sexed by visual inspection, whilst the sex of head remains was assigned by analysing the cephalic scale morphology using geometric morphometrics. Our results show that the risk of being predated by a kestrel in our population was overall about 3.55 times higher for males than for females. To our knowledge this is the first study showing a male-biased predation in a lizard species. The selective predation of males was consistent between years over the 8-year study period (1999-2006) and also consistent between the three types of kestrel hunting habitat. Overall predation rates on lizards differed between habitats, depending on the year. We propose that the observed sex-biased predation is mainly due to sex differences in lizard behaviour.
