GNM_311,Pavel2004171,The impact of grazing animals on nesting success of grassland passerines in farmland and natural habitats: A field experiment,"Pavel, V.",Folia Zoologica,53,2,171-178,2004,NA,"A study was made of the influence of trampling by grazing animals on the nesting success of real nests (meadow pipit, Anthus pralensis; water pipit, Anthus spinoletta; and skylark, Alauda arvensis) and simulated nests (caps from jam-jars filled by green plasticine) on pasture in the OrlickÃ© Mountains and on unmanaged alpine meadows in the JesenÃ­ky Mountains (Czech Republic, Central Europe). While the pasture was continuously grazed by livestock at high densities, unmanaged alpine meadow was grazed only by wild large herbivores at far lower densities. Trampling was the primary cause of nest failure in the OrlickÃ© Mountains, but was infrequent in the Jeseniky Mountains. The number of real nests lost by trampling corresponded to simulated nests within the localities. Spatial distribution of simulated nests had no effect on their survival on intensively grazed fields. The results indicate that grazing animals negatively influenced the nesting success of real and simulated nests of grassland passerines on continuously grazed mountain pasture. The use of simulated nests was an adequate method of predicting trampling losses by natural nests.",314,1,excluded,No green nest material

A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals and across contexts.

For each of 30 declining species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4) specific conservation measures and (5) agri-environment schemes. Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed-eating birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all 30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from options available in one or more agri-environment schemes. Four aspects of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1) weed-control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of hedgerows and `rough patches', have affected smaller numbers of species, as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at least eight species have shown recent increases in their national population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of agricultural practice is changed.",145,2,excluded,Not empirical
GNM_052,D.U.00C3..U.00AD.azLora2020,Hoopoe Upupa epops male feeding effort is related to female cosmetic egg colouration,"DÃ­az Lora, S. and PÃ©rez-Contreras, T. and AzcÃ¡rate-GarcÃ­a, M. and MartÃ­nez Bueno, M. and Soler, J.J. and MartÃ­n-Vivaldi, M.",Journal of Avian Biology,51,8,NA,2020,10.1111/jav.02433,"Avian eggshell colouration might function as a post-mating sexually selected signal of female quality, influencing male parental investment and, hence, reproductive success. This hypothesis has been tested for intrinsic eggshell pigments as biliverdin (blue-green colouration) and/or protoporphyrin (brown coloured spots), but never for colourations applied post-laying. Post-laying staining colouration due to, for instance, uropygial secretion of the female could reflect its phenotypic properties and, thus, might be a cue for male investment in reproduction. In hoopoes, the uropygial gland of incubating females hosts symbiotic bacteria that are responsible for the brown colour of their uropygial secretion and of the eggshells, as they cover their bluish-grey eggshells with gland secretion after laying. The secretion protects embryos from pathogenic trans-shell infections and, thus, egg colouration may function as a cue or even as a post-mating sexually selected signal of antimicrobial potential in hoopoes. In a wild hoopoe population breeding in nest boxes in Spain, we test this hypothesis by exploring whether egg colour predicts male parental investment. In accordance with the hypothesis, we found that the amount of food provided by males to incubating females was higher in nests with less saturated eggshell colours. This relationship was affected by female body condition. High quality females in terms of body condition and/or in secretion colour obtained better males in terms of provisioning effort during incubation. Given that eggshell saturation is negatively related to density of bacterial symbionts in uropygial secretions, one possibility is that males may regulate their parental investment in accordance to the expected characteristics of mutualistic bacteria hosted in uropygial glands and deposited on eggshells. We discuss alternative explanations for our results, concluding that the post-mating sexual selection hypothesis is the most likely but experimental modification of egg colour is needed to test it further.

Spotless starling males (Sturnus unicolor) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male-biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female-female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male-biased sex ratios and female resource-holding potential in intra-sexual competition in this species.

The effects of climate warming on forage plant growth are expected to be larger at the Arctic breeding grounds than in temperate wintering grounds, potentially disrupting this green wave and causing waterfowl to mistime their arrival on the breeding grounds. We studied the potential effect of climate warming on timing of food peaks along the migratory flyway of the Russian population of barnacle geese using a warming experiment with open-top chambers. We measured the effect of 1.0â€“1.7Â°C experimental warming on forage plant biomass and nitrogen concentration at three sites along the migratory flyway (temperate wintering site, temperate spring stopover site, and Arctic breeding site) during 2Â months for two consecutive years. We found that experimental warming increased biomass accumulation and sped up the decline in nitrogen concentration of forage plants at the Arctic breeding site but not at temperate wintering and stop-over sites. Increasing spring temperatures in the Arctic will thus shorten the food peak of nitrogen-rich forage at the breeding grounds. Our results further suggest an advance of the local food peak in the Arctic under 1â€“2Â°C climate warming, which will likely cause migrating geese to mistime their arrival at the breeding grounds, particularly considering the Arctic warms faster than the temperate regions. The combination of a shorter food peak and mistimed arrival is likely to decrease goose reproductive success under climate warming by reducing growth and survival of goslings after hatching.

GNM_253,Su201569,Removal of indoor carbon dioxide and formaldehyde using green walls by bird nest fern,"Su, Y.-M. and Lin, C.-H.",Horticulture Journal,84,1,69-76,2015,10.2503/hortj.CH-114,"This paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of removing air pollutants by installing green vertical walls filled with potted plants. Most people in urban areas spend 80â€“90% of their lives indoors, indicating the significance of indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are the most common sources of indoor pollution; their levels can be reduced by using potted plants, which provide the additional benefit of beautification. In accordance with our previous study, for this purpose, we used bird nest fern (Asplenium nidus Linn.), which has a high rate of transpiration and is easy to grow indoors. Upon using 3 treatments involving the release of CO2, HCHO, or CO2 + HCHO, the experimental results showed that bird nest fern can reduce the concentration of CO2 from 2000â€¯ppm to a safe 800â€¯ppm at an average of 1.984â€¯ppmÂ·h-1 (per pot). By contrast, the concentration of HCHO was reduced from 2â€¯ppm to the safe level of 0.1â€¯ppm, at an average of 0.003â€¯ppmÂ·h-1 (per pot). Regarding temperature and humidity, the results showed a decrease of 2Â°C indoors and an increase of 10% relative humidity. These results show that bird nest fern has high rates of CO2and HCHO removal, reduces temperature, and raises relative humidity. Â© 2015 The Japanese Society for Horticultural Science (JSHS).

It has been suggested that arteriolar annuli localized in retinal arterioles regulate retinal blood flow acting as sphincters. Here, the morphology and protein expression profile of arteriolar annuli have been analyzed under physiologic conditions in the retina of wildtype, Î²-actin-Egfp, and Nestin-gfp transgenic mice. Additionally, to study the effect of hypertension, the KAP transgenic mouse has been used. METHODS. Cellular architecture has been studied using digested whole mount retinas and transmission electron microscopy. The profile of protein expression has been analyzed on paraffin sections and whole mount retinas by immunofluorescence and histochemistry. RESULTS. The ultrastructural analysis of arteriolar annuli showed a different cell population found between endothelial and muscle cells that matched most of the morphologic criteria established to define interstitial Cajal cells. The profile of protein expression of these vascular interstitial cells (VICs) was similar to that of interstitial Cajal cells and different from the endothelial and smooth muscle cells, because they expressed b-actin, nestin, and CD44, but they did not express CD31 and a-SMA or scarcely express F-actin. Furthermore, VICs share with pericytes the expression of NG2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-Î²). The high expression of Ano1 and high activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase observed in VICs was diminished during hypertensive retinopathy suggesting that these cells might play a role on the motility of arteriolar annuli and that this function is altered during hypertension. CONCLUSIONS. A novel type of VICs has been described in the arteriolar annuli of mouse retina. Remarkably, these cells undergo important molecular modifications during hypertensive retinopathy and might thus be a therapeutic target against this disease.

GNM_117,Christianini2010573,Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal in a neotropical savanna,"Christianini, A.V. and Oliveira, P.S.",Journal of Ecology,98,3,573-582,2010,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01653.x,"A substantial portion of the crop of fruiting trees falls beneath parent plants as a result of dispersal failure. Such diaspores are considered as waste because the likelihood of plant recruitment is usually very small close to parent trees. However, many animals may rescue fallen diaspores and provide them with another chance of dispersal and establishment. We investigated the effectiveness of two broad types of seed dispersal vectors for the regeneration of Xylopia aromatica in the Brazilian cerrado savanna: birds that remove diaspores from plant canopies and ants that harvest diaspores on the ground under the parent plant (as rescuers) or from bird feces (as secondary dispersers). Birds removed a mean of 32% of the crop from plant canopies, but removal was independent of crop size. A large part of the crop (mean of 25%) landed beneath parent plants or was dropped after manipulation by vertebrate frugivores as viable diaspores. Ants from at least five genera removed most fallen diaspores (up to 83%) within 24 h. Ants influenced the fate of a large amount of the crop, and for some trees ants removed as many diaspores as birds. Large ants rescued some diaspores to distances beyond the parent plant crown, but birds may remove diaspores 40-fold farther. However, seedlings of X. aromatica were only found close to nests of large ants, probably due to diaspore rescuing and/or directed secondary dispersal by certain ant groups following primary dispersal by birds. Although an unknown percentage of seeds was lost to granivorous ants, diaspore removal by ants potentially enhances the likelihood of plant recruitment due to distance-related benefits and directed dispersal to ant nests, while birds play a premier role in long-distance seed dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. Synthesis. Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal at different spatial scales to X. aromatica. Since ants remove most fallen diaspores beneath parent plants, the use of diaspore removal rates from plant canopy as a surrogate of plant fitness may be misleading. By acting as secondary dispersers, ants may also provide a fine-tuned dispersal following long-distance dispersal by birds (i.e. diplochory). Â© 2010 The Authors.

Big River is subject to metal pollution via erosion and seepage from large tailings piles from inactive lead mines. Black River drains part of a currently mined area. Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), and green-backed herons (Butorides striatus) collected downstream from the source of metal contamination to Big River had significantly (ANOVA, P<0.05) higher lead and cadmium levels than specimens collected at either an uncontaminated upstream site or on Black River. Northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon) had elevated lead levels below the tailings source, but did not seem to accumulate cadmium. Levels of lead, cadmium, or zinc in northern rough-winged swallows (Stelgidopteryx serripennis) were not related to collecting locality. Carcasses of ten bank swallows (Riparia riparia) collected from a colony nesting in a tailings pile along the Big River had lead concentrations of 2.0-39 ppm wet weight. Differences between zinc concentrations in vertebrates collected from contaminated and uncontaminated sites were less apparent than differences in lead and cadmium. There was little relationship between metal concentrations in the animals studied and their trophic levels. Bullfrogs are the most promising species examined for monitoring environmental levels of lead, cadmium, and zinc.

Where population density is high, visibility is low and repeated interactions occur between known social companions, calls are often individually recognizable. Parrots are highly social and make substantial daily movements, which appear to be mediated through contact calling. However, there is little experimental evidence for how free-ranging parrots recognize social companions. We quantified intra- and interindividual variation of contact calls in a banded population of green-rumped parrotlets in Venezuela. Recordings of a sample of males were made on replicate days as they announced their return to incubating mates. Spectrographic structure of these contact calls showed significantly more variation between than within individuals, and calls could be correctly classified to individuals more often than was expected by chance. Males varied across multiple dimensions simultaneously, including duration, frequency and frequency modulation of contact calls. Playback experiments showed that free-ranging female parrotlets responded significantly more often to their mates' calls than to calls of males of other nests. Mate recognition via contact calls may be selectively advantageous during incubation and brooding if this reduces the potential costs associated with confusing contact calls of mates with those of nonmates, including infanticidal conspecifics.

There was an association of successful corridor nests with vegetation heterogeneity or patchiness, and successful forest nests with mature undisturbed forest habitat and concealing cover around the nest. Mixed-habitat bird species appeared to be more general in their nest microhabitat requirements than forest birds. Because shrub patches functioned as refugia for nesting mixed-habitat birds, patchy systems should have a higher fitness than homogeneous systems. Predators apparently were not able to exploit the patchily distributed nests.

Zoological Studies 49(4): 437-452. Green turtles Chelonia mydas nest year round at the Ras Al Hadd Nature Reserve, Oman, with a distinct lower-density nesting season from Oct. to May, and a higher-density nesting season from June to Sept. On these beaches, the main predators of turtle eggs and hatchlings are foxes Vulpes spp., wolves Canis lupus arabs, and wild cats Felis spp. and Caracal caracal schmitzi. During 1999-2001, both the nesting behavior of these turtles and the diets of foxes (the main predator on the beaches) were investigated, and we tested whether female turtles were able to avoid/reduce predation pressure on their eggs and hatchlings on the nesting grounds. Elsewhere in the region and globally, foxes are known to feed on rodents, lizards, birds, and insects, but at Ras Al Hadd, their diet is basically composed of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings (comprising about 95\% in volume), with smaller contributions from other marine invertebrates (mostly ghost crabs Ocypode spp. and large gastropods), although they also sporadically ingested birds and lizards. The ability to adapt to a diet of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, on these beaches, is certainly a factor behind the success of this carnivore community in the arid lands of the Arabian Peninsula. Field experiments indicated that nesting sea turtles recognized both natural predators and humans as threats to their offspring, and this was reflected in modifications to their nesting behavior. In relatively undisturbed areas (by both natural predators and humans), sea turtle nest density was significantly higher, and nests were placed further away from the surf's edge, in contrast to results from relatively disturbed areas, where turtle nests were closer to the surf's edge, thus reducing the distance hatchlings had to travel when they emerge and begin their journey to the sea. Nesting turtles interrupted their nesting cycle if they sensed the presence of people or foxes, returning to the sea without laying a clutch. However, if they had already initiated oviposition when they sensed the presence of people and/or predators, they continued, although they significantly increased efforts to camouflage their nests. Other reasons behind nest site abandonment included sand collapsing events (critical during preparation of the egg chamber) and intraspecific competition for nest sites. These behavioral patterns of sea turtles result from their evolutionary adaptation to nesting on beaches, which surely played a role in their survival, but also highlight the importance of minimizing human disturbance and activities on turtle nesting beaches. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.4/437.pdf",116,2,excluded,Not birds

Fungal endophytes'fungi that live asymptomatically within plant tissues'are a pervasive group of symbionts well known for their role in mediating host-responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, they also may become pathogenic and often impose metabolic costs on hosts. Here, we examine the role of fungal endophytes in mediating responses of the host grass red fescue (Festuca rubra) to salt and herbivore stress. We collected 38 red fescue genotypes from within its native range on Akimiski Island, Nunavut, Canada, where it occurs in the supratidal region on the northern part of the island and is heavily grazed by nesting and brood-rearing snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis). We screened all plants for the presence of the systemic endophyte EpichloÃ« festucae and sequenced the nonsystemic endophytic community on a subset of these plants. While we did not detect E. festucae, our plants instead were host to a diverse array of nonsystemic fungal endophytes. We then conducted a fully factorial greenhouse experiment where we crossed plant genotype (4 levels) with simulated grazing (clipped or unclipped), endophyte status (present or absent) and salinity (0, 32 or 64 ppt) to examine the ecological role of this endophytic community. Overall, the presence of nonsystemic endophytes increased plant survival, but only in the absence of salt or clipping. On the other hand, these endophytes reduced plant tolerance to simulated herbivory by 69% but had no effect on aboveground plant growth. Thus, our results identify a potential nonsystemic endophyte-mediated trade-offin host plant survival and tolerance to herbivory and suggest this trade-offmay be altered by stressful abiotic conditions.

The simplification and homogenisation of agricultural landscapes has led to dramatic losses of farmland biodiversity. This decline includes passerine populations and one of the mechanisms that may be contributing toward this may be increased nest predation. Ground covers are agri-environmental measures whose objective is to halt the loss of biodiversity by creating high-quality habitat patches embedded in a homogeneous landscape by maintaining herbaceous ground cover within crops. However, although such patches are selected by breeding birds, they may also attract predators, and an increased nest density in small habitat patches would thus result in increased predation rates. We have therefore performed nest predation experiments with artificial nests in order to investigate whether the effect of ground cover on nest predation is density dependent. The experiments were carried out during the breeding season in 2014, in two areas of olive groves in southern Spain. We used two nest density levels, both in olive groves with ground cover and in those where the ground was bare. A total of 420 nests were placed, 226 of which (53.81%) suffered predation. Our results showed that 1) nest predation was density dependent in olive groves with ground cover only with respect to tree nests, while there was no density-dependent predation in bare-ground olive groves of either ground-based or tree nests, and 2) artificial nests placed on the ground were more frequently depredated (65%) than those placed in trees (29%), irrespective of either the presence of vegetation cover or nest density. This study suggests that variations in patterns of nest predation are determined by the identity of nest predators and their specific foraging behaviours in different landscapes and habitats. It also underscores the need to implement agri-environmental measures aimed at the conservation of farmland birds.",235,1,excluded,No green nest material

In order to obtain information on European breeds of beef cattle (Bos taurus taurus) in temperate climate zones, individual records of body weight and welfare indicators were obtained from 130 beef cattle. These belonged to four herds and were randomly allocated to two contiguous plots: Silvopastoral Systems (SPS) and Open Pastures Systems (OPS). The SPS in this study were areas with exotic trees of Eucalyptus globulus globulus for paper pulp production planted in a 2 Ã— 2 design (two meters between each tree) over diverse, native grasses. The OPS were large open areas with a great diversity of native grasses, herbs, and small plots of trees where the animals could rest and shelter from extreme weather conditions. Over the course of one year, individual body weights and a number of specific animal welfare indicators were measured every 45 days. After a descriptive analysis, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Gaussian distribu-tion, with time and system (OPS or SPS) fitted as fixed effects and individuals nested by herd as random intercepts, was used. The results showed that weight gain did not differ between the two systems. None of the animals showed any sign of impaired welfare in either system over the study period. Silvopastoral systems offer animals a sustainable and richer environment that will improves their welfare. The additional income provided by the wood production allows the farmers to main-tain their traditional cattle farming lifestyle. Â© 2021 by the authors.

The majority of general life-history models treat the environment as being invariable through time, even though temporal variation in selective agents could dramatically change the outcomes, e.g. in terms of optimal size and time at maturity. For herbivorous insects, seasonal differences in food quality are reasonably well described, but seasonal dynamics of top-down selective forces are poorly documented. 2. The present study attempted to quantify seasonal changes in predation risk of folivorous insect larvae in temperate forest habitats. In a series of field experiments, artificial larvae were exposed to predators, and the resulting bird-inflicted damage was recorded. The trials were repeated regularly throughout the course of two summers. 3. A distinct peak of larval mortality was recorded in mid-June (the nestling period for most insectivorous passerine birds), after which predation risk declined to a plateau of 20-30\% below the peak value. 4. The recorded pattern is interpreted as a consequence of seasonal changes in the number and behaviour of insectivorous birds, and the abundance of alternative food resources for these predators. 5.

For birds, ultraviolet (UV) light is important for a number of their behaviors, including mate selection, foraging, and nesting. Many captive birds, however, are housed indoors without access to natural light and without UV-supplemented lighting; a practice which may negatively impact their welfare. Understanding how birds use UV light, and assessing its relative importance, is necessary to provide optimal care in captive settings. Accordingly, we tested the preference for UV light shown by 67 birds housed at Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, USA, and its impact on their behavior. We tested 18 species which represented three natural ecologies typified by different natural light levels: high light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in savannas or seashores), patchy light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in forested areas), and circumpolar dwellers (e.g., birds that live near the poles). Experiment 1 investigated the birds' lighting preferences through simultaneous presentation of areas of their exhibit lit with supplemental ultraviolet light (UV+ zone) and with standard artificial light. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of supplemental UV light on these birds' behavioral repertoire. Birds from high light and circumpolar environments showed a preference for the side of their enclosure to which UV light was added. High light birds were recorded in the UV+ zone during 64\% trials and, similarly, circumpolar birds were observed in this UV+ zone for 61\% of trials; a significant preference for UV+ zone, P < 0.001 for both. Perhaps mimicking their natural habitat of part-sun and part-shade, in Experiment 1 birds from patchy light environments split their time evenly within their enclosure (they were recorded in the UV+ zone for 54\% of trials). When in an environment with added UV light, birds from patchy light habitats were more sociable: the percentage of their observation trials spent in proximity and in contact with other birds increased from 5\% to 11\% (P = 0.026). Although certain birds showed a preference for the added UV light, none showed changes in their behavioral repertoire beyond the sociability measure. We discuss this preference for UV-supplemented environments and the management implications for zoos and other captive facilities which house birds indoors. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A range of timings of band and overall spray treatments of glyphosate to GMHT sugar beet were compared with a conventional weed control programme in four field trials over 2 years. Single overall sprays applied between 200 and 250 accumulated day degrees (above a base air temperature of 3degreesC; degreesCd) and band applied treatments applied at 10\% or 20\% ground cover within the crop rows generally gave significantly greater weed biomass and seed rain than conventional treatments, while later band sprays (more than 650degreesCd) reduced seed return. Two overall sprays of glyphosate produced low weed biomass and generally lowest seed return of all treatments but tended to give some of the highest yields. However, the early overall sprays (200-250degreesCd) and band sprays gave as good or better yields than the conventional and were generally equivalent to the two overall-spray programme. Viable seeds in the soil after the experiment were generally higher following the early overall (200-250degreesCd) and the band spray treatments than following the conventional. The results show that altered management of GMHT sugar beet can provide alternative scenarios to those of the recent Farm Scale Evaluation trials. Without yield loss they can enhance weed seed banks and autumn bird food availability compared with conventional management, or provide early season benefits to invertebrates and nesting birds, depending on the system chosen. Conventional weed control does not have the flexibility to enable these scenarios that benefit both agriculture and environment, although there may be some options for increasing weed seed return in autumn.",31,2,excluded,No green nest material

However, males of some songbird species, such as the European starling (Stumus vulgaris), continue to sing at high levels after the breeding season, when T levels are basal. In male starlings song during the breeding season functions mainly to attract mates, whereas song during the nonbreeding season appears unrelated to reproduction. This suggests that song produced in a context unrelated to female courtship, unlike song directed toward females, is not regulated by plasma T. In captive males housed in large outdoor aviaries we explored the relationship between plasma T and song produced during the breeding season within and outside a courtship context. This was achieved by determining the effects of castration and subsequent T treatment on song and mate attraction behaviors in both the presence and the absence of a female. Compared to intact males, castrated males did not show reduced song activity in the absence of a female for at least 6 months after the operation, strongly suggesting that the expression of noncourtship song is not regulated by plasma T. Likewise, we found that experimentally elevating T levels in castrated males did not affect noncourtship song rates. However, control castrated males receiving empty implants tended to show reduced noncourtship song rates after implantation. This may have been due to a suppressive effect caused by the presence of the T-implanted castrated males in the same aviary. In contrast, courtship singing was clearly controlled by plasma T: it was abolished by castration and restored by subsequent T replacement when males were housed both individually and in a group situation. High plasma levels of T also appeared necessary for the activation of three other behavioral traits critical for mate attraction, namely, nesthole occupancy, spending time (singing) in a nesthole, and carrying green nesting material into a nesthole.

Earlier studies showed that uniparental Arctic sandpipers overall spend less time incubating their eggs than biparental species, but interspecific differences in size and ecology were potential confounding factors. This study reports on a within-species comparison of breeding schedules and metal egg temperatures in uni- and biparental sanderlings (Calidris alba) in Northeast Greenland in relation to ambient temperature. We recorded incubation schedules with nest temperature loggers in 34 sanderling clutches (13 uniparentals, 21 biparentals). The temperature of a metal egg placed within the clutch of 17 incubating birds (6 uniparentals, 9 biparentals) was measured as an indicator of the heat put into eggs. Recess frequency, recess duration and total recess time were higher in uniparentals than in biparentals and positively correlated with ambient temperatures in uniparentals only. Uniparental sanderlings maintained significantly higher metal egg temperatures during incubation than biparentals (1.4Â°C difference on average). Our results suggest that uniparental sanderlings compensate for the lower nest attendance, which may prolong the duration of the incubation period and negatively affect the condition of the hatchlings, by maintaining a higher heat flux into the eggs.

A special case is the secretion in the hoopoes Upupa epops, and green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus, which, contrary to the commonly white and odourless secretions, are dark with pungent odour. Recently, bacteria have been isolated from glands of both woodhoopoes and hoopoes and here we test the hypothesis that bacteria are responsible of some of the special properties of glands and secretions of this group of birds. We explore natural seasonal changes and intersexual differences in the properties of hoopoe glands and secretions, check the natural occurrence of bacteria within secretions, and analyse the effect of experimental injection of antibiotics on uropygial gland properties. Male glands underwent no seasonal changes, and their secretions were invariably white and odourless, very similar to female glands outside the breeding season. However, in comparison to the uropygial gland of non-breeding females, those of incubating females showed a marked increase in size and volume of secretion produced, which became dark and pungent. All these parameters increased until the hatching date and returned to values similar to those in the prelaying phase towards the end of the nestling period. Nestling glands produced secretions similar to those of females in colour and odour. Gland size of both females and nestlings predicted the amount of secretion produced. Microscopic techniques confirmed the presence of bacteria at high density and in active division in all dark secretions examined. The antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the load of enterococci in nestling glands, did not affect size of glands, but diminished the volume of secretion, which was lighter in colour than that of control nestlings. In nesting females, the experimental injection of antibiotic affected some measurements of gland size and secretion colour. Because the experiment did not affect general health estimates (immunocompetence, body condition or growing) of nestlings, our results suggest that some of the special properties of hoopoe glands are mediated by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.

Species-rich canopies (five or more species) in the reference marsh were taller and had more (13 vs. 7) layers than monotypes of Salicornia virginica, although both had 100% cover. Cover and layering were greater for three- and six-species plots than for one-species plots in both the field experiment (70 2 x 2 m plots, eight herbaceous halophytes) and greenhouse (same treatments). Cover (80-95%) and heights were similar among field experimental treatments after two growing seasons (18 mo after planting seedlings in April 1997). In years 3-4, heights (âˆ¼0.5 m) and cover (âˆ¼100%) were similar to those of the 1998 reference marsh data, but only 1-3 canopy layers had developed. Species effects became evident when assemblages were replicated in the greenhouse. The eight one-species treatments differed in cover, height, and layering, and complementary traits produced more layers in multispecies canopies than monotypes. Within the three- and six-species canopies, attributes were similar for most assemblages, but there was a slight height effect with S. virginica, as in the field. In general, the effects of individual species were best distinguished by heights, and species-richness effects by layering. Of relevance to the larger diversity debate is our finding that the attribute examined influenced perceptions of the importance of species number vs. species composition. To apply our results, managers would assess height and layering, not just vegetation cover. Salt marsh restorationists would establish species-rich assemblages in newly graded sites to accelerate the development of canopy height and layering. Monitoring efforts would continue until canopy architecture matches that of reference systems (>4 yr for Californian marshes planted on coarse, nutrient-poor soils).

The present paper describes some experiments on the function of this response, and on the stimuli eliciting it. Carrion Crows and Herring Gulls find white eggs more readily than normal gulls' eggs; it is concluded that the natural colours of the eggs afford a certain degree of cryptic protection. When normal eggs are given an egg shell at 15 cm. distance their vulnerability is greatly increased; this â€œbetrayal effectâ€� decreases rapidly with increased distance between egg and shell. We therefore conclude that egg shell removal helps to protect the brood from predators. As reported by C. BEER (1960) the Black-headed Gull removes a surprisingly wide range of objects from the nest. Large scale tests with egg shell dummies in which colour, shape, size and distance from the nest were varied showed that objects of all colours are carried but that â€œkhakiâ€� (the normal ground colour of the egg) and white are particularly stimulating, while green elicits very few responses. Egg shells elicit more responses than cylindrical rings of the same colour, and these are responded to better than â€œanglesâ€�. Size can be varied within wide limits; very large rings elicit fear which interferes with removal. Various other indications are mentioned which show that the score as obtained in the mass tests does not accurately reflect the responsiveness of the reaction itself but rather the result of its interaction with other behaviour tendencies. The eliciting effect decreases rapidly with increasing distance. On the whole, the gulls' response is very well adapted to its main function of selectively removing the empty shell, but the relatively high scores for objects which have very little resemblance to egg shells suggest that it is adapted to the removal of any object which might make the brood more conspicuous. A pilot test showed that gulls which have incubated black eggs respond better to black egg shell dummies than normal gulls. The lack of promptness of the response as compared with non-colonial waders (Ringed Plover and Oystercatcher) is adaptive, since it tends to reduce predation by other Black-headed Gulls, which are shown to prey selectively on wet chicks. A hitherto unrecognised function of territory is suggested. In a discussion of the entire anti-predator system of the Black-headed Gull its complexity and its compromise character are stressed: the safety demands of the individual clash with those of the brood; there are conflicts between the several safety devices which each benefit the brood; and there are clashes between the ideal safety measures required by each type of predator.",383,1,excluded,No green nest material
GNM_164,X.WOS.000167035100001,Bioenergetics and nutrition of Mississippi Valley population Canada geese during winter and migration,"Gates, RJ and Caithamer, DF and Moritz, WE and Tacha, TC",WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS,NA,146,Jan-65,2001,NA,"Survival and reproduction of northern-nesting geese are potentially affected by body condition during the non-breeding season. Body condition is presumed to be determined by the quantity of food available to geese during autumn, winter, and spring migration. However, food resources likely do not limit populations that exploit agricultural systems. Other factors such as hunting, refuge management, diet quality, weather may affect survival and reproduction. We studied time-energy budgets, food intake, and body condition to determine how Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) of the Mississippi Valley Population (MVP) acquire and utilize energy and nutrients during autumn, winter, and spring migration during 1984-1989. Abundant food and behavioral flexibility allowed MVP Canada geese to exist on a high nutritional plane. Food intake was sufficient to meet or exceed daily energy and protein requirements except during winter. High energy, low protein diets fueled deposition of large lipid reserves, and were adequate to meet protein requirements during autumn in east-central Wisconsin. Late migrant geese that spent autumn in east-central Wisconsin expended more energy (x = 583 kcal/day) yet deposited more lipid (x = 4.51 g) compared to early migrants that spent autumn in southern Illinois (x = 526 kcal/day, x = 151 g lipid) during 1984 and 1985. Both groups averaged 4.5 hr feeding/day during autumn and consumed similar quantities (dry mass) of food (x = 187-190 g/day). However, late migrants consumed a high energy (x = 3.67 kcal/g) low protein (x = 12\%) diet comprised mostly of corn (x = 81\%) during autumn in east-central Wisconsin. Early migrants consumed a lower energy (x = 2.99 kcal/g) but higher protein (24\%) diet that consisted mostly of green forages (x = 24\% dry mass) in soybeans (x = 28\%) in southern Illinois. Wintering geese consumed a high energy (x = 3.49 kcal/g) diet with intermediate protein content (x = 19\%). Corn (x = 58\%) and soybeans (x = 22\%) comprised most of dry matter intake during winter in southern Illinois when daily energy expenditure averaged 536 kcal/day. However food intake declined (x = 152 g food/ day) during winter when geese averaged 3.5 hr feeding/day. Variation in crop food energy relative to population energy requirements on 2 southern Illinois refuges did not impact body condition during 1984-1989. Nutrient reserves contributed minimally (<1-6\%) to meeting daily energy requirements, so geese left winter refuges with more lipid and similar protein masses compared to early autumn. Geese exhibited a wide range of behavioral adaptation to spatial and temporal variation in food resources and nutritional requirements. Late migrants entered winter with larger energy reserves than early migrants during 1984-1989. Although early and late migrants were sympatric in southern Illinois during winter, they converged to similar levels of body condition by the end of winter during 1986-1989. Late migrants apparently used stored energy to reduce food intake, possibly to minimize mortality during winter. Early migrants apparently minimized exposure to hunting by feeding almost entirely within refuges during autumn. With smaller energy reserves, early migrants maintained higher levels of energy intake to maintain body condition after autumn, possibly increasing mortality risk during winter. We expected more similar trends in body condition between early and late migrant Canada geese, and more consistent losses of nutrient reserves each year if winter weight declines were driven by an endogenous physiological rhythm. We see no reason to invoke an endogenously driven physiological mechanism to explain winter weight losses in MVP Canada geese. Without controlled metabolic experiments, we prefer the simpler and more plausible explanation that winter weight declines result from facultative adjustments of feeding behavior to weather conditions, food availability, and pre-winter nutrient reserves. Overwinter survival should be enhanced by an energetic strategy that balances potential benefits and risks of feeding in relation to the size of remaining nutrient reserves. Decline of the early migrant tradition during the 1990's suggests that the energetic strategy of late migrants is more suited to recent harvest and refuge management regimes. Adults deposited 73\% (females) and 28\% (males) of their spring protein reserves while migrating between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Spring lipid reserves were acquired mostly (84\% in females, 92\% in males) during a 4-5 week staging period in east-central Wisconsin. Juveniles deposited 41-51\% of lipid reserves and 80-91\% of protein between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Feeding time (x = 5.8 hr/day), and food intake (x = 263 g/day) increased during spring-staging when lipid reserves more than doubled. Spring-staging geese consumed a moderate energy (x = 3.25 kcal/g) low protein (x = 13\%) diet that was more evenly composed of corn (x = 50\%), wild seeds and rootstocks (x = 21\%), and green forages (x = 27\%) compared to autumn and winter. Deposition of nutrient reserves was neither time- nor resource-limited during spring migration. Thus, food resources likely did not limit reproduction of MVP Canada geese under the conditions we observed during 1984-1989. Shallow wetland and moist soil habitats can be enhanced on southern Illinois refuges to benefit a wider diversity of wetland-dependent species and provide nutritional resources for geese without compromising energy available to support wintering populations. However, geese still need an abundant source of energy during autumn and winter, particularly when foraging opportunities are restricted by inclement weather or hunting. Food restriction on winter refuges during long and late-closing hunting seasons in the 1990's may have contributed to long-term changes in autumn migration patterns and wintering traditions in southern Illinois. Forage and non-crop foods are essential sources of protein and other nutrients during all seasons. but are especially important during spring migration. Shallow wetlands and lowland pastures on private lands in central Illinois and east-central Wisconsin are critical sources of non-crop foods that provide essential nutrients that geese use to complete the nesting cycle. Thus, reproduction could be impaired in the future if changing land use and farming practices reduce availability of moist soil and lowland pasture habitats.",164,1,excluded,No green nest material

Methods: Thrombus capture rates of 10 permanent and retrievable vena cava filters were tested in vitro in vertical and horizontal positions with thrombus diameters of 3 and 5 mm (length 30 mm) and tube diameters of 21 and 28 mm. Testing included the new TrapEase filter. Results were compared statistically using Fisher's exact test (capture rates) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (construction). Results: Best-ranked filters were the Bird's Nest, the TrapEase and the Simon Nitinol filters. The Tempofilter, the Greenfield and the Keeper filter performed worst. Thrombus capture rates were significantly higher in the vertical position and also higher for large thrombi and in the small cava diameter. Conical filters performed worse than filters with two or more filtration levels. Conclusion: Filters with two or more filtration levels show the highest filtration efficiency in vitro and can be recommended, especially for the critically ill who will probably not tolerate even small emboli. The TrapEase filter is a promising device and should be evaluated clinically.",321,1,excluded,Out of field

First, on account of birds being able to see in the ultraviolet spectrum, the interaction between the properties of avian vision and the light environment of nests imply different perceptions of egg coloration from those experienced by humans. Second, a new hypothesis to explain blue green egg coloration interprets it as a sexually selected signal to males of the laying female's genetic quality. Third, evidence from taxa as divergent as sparrowhawks and great tits indicates that protoporphyrin pigments responsible for maculation (spotting patterns) have a structural function in compensating for eggshell thinning, as caused by calcium stress, and, more recently, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. We consider this to be the most convincing explanation for the primary function of spotting, although an important secondary function might arise through the fact that individual patterns of maculation may allow birds to identify their own eggs, effectively serving as signatures in the face of inter- or intra-specific brood parasitism. These constraints or hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and should not be taken to imply that one, but not other, agents of selection might apply to any one species. However, the sexually-selected eggshell coloration hypothesis is least plausible for hole-nesting birds because of the poor light quality available, although such species have been the focus of research in this area, and only a single experimental study has shown a link between egg coloration and male provisioning. Furthermore, the observed relationships between female phenotypic quality and egg traits do not necessarily imply that they have signalling functions.

Satellite telemetry revealed that most submergences were short (<5min) but that some submergences were longer (>20min), particularly at night. TDRs revealed that much of the time was spent conducting short (2-4 min), shallow (approximately 0.9-1.5m) dives, consistent with predictions for optimisation of near-surface travelling, while long (typically 20-30 min), deep (typically 10-20 m) dives had a distinctive profile found in other marine reptiles. These results suggest that green turtles crossing the Atlantic do not behave invariantly, but instead alternate between periods of travelling just beneath the surface and diving deeper.

Compared with tern eggs from Lake Poygan, eggs from Green Bay had significantly higher median concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), other polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), total (three congeners) non-ortho, ortho' PCBs, five individual PCB congeners known to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and several other organochlorine contaminants. Conversions of analytical concentrations of TCDD and PCB congeners based on relative AHH induction potencies allowed for estimation of total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents. Two PCB congeners, 2,3,3â€²,4,4â€²- and 3,3â€²,4,4â€²,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PeCB) accounted for more than 90% of the median estimated TCDD equivalents at both Green Bay and Lake Poygan. The median estimated TCDD equivalents were almost 11-fold higher in tern eggs from Green Bay than in eggs from Lake Poygan (2175 and 201 pg/g). The hatching success of Green Bay sibling eggs from nests where eggs were collected for contaminant analyses was 75% lower at Green Bay than at Lake Poygan. Hatchability of eggs taken from other nests and artificially incubated was about 50% lower for Green Bay than for Lake Poygan. Among hatchlings from laboratory incubation, those from Green Bay weighed approximately 20% less and had a mean liver weight to body weight ratio 26% greater than those from Lake Poygan. In both field and laboratory, mean minimum incubation periods were significantly longer for eggs from Green Bay compared to Lake Poygan (8.25 and 4.58 days, respectively). Mean minimum incubation time for Green Bay eggs in the field was 4.37 days longer than in the laboratory. Hatchability was greatly improved when Green Bay eggs were incubated by Lake Poygan adults in an egg-exchange experiment, but was sharply decreased in Lake Poygan eggs incubated in Green Bay nests. Nest abandonment and egg disappearance were substantial at Green Bay but nil at Lake Poygan. Thus, not only factors intrinsic to the egg, but also extrinsic factors (parental attentiveness), impaired reproductive outcome at Green Bay. The epidemiological evidence from this study strongly suggested that contaminants were a causal factor. AHH-active PCB congeners (intrinsic effects) and PCBs in general (extrinsic effects) appeared to be the only contaminants at the concentrations measured in eggs, capable of producing the effects that were observed at Green Bay.

Secretions from the preen gland of birds are used for this purpose, although its chemicals apparently are produced by the birds themselves. European hoopoes Upupa epops and green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus harbour symbiotic bacteria in the uropygial gland that might be partly responsible for the chemical composition of secretions. Here we investigate the antimicrobial activity of the volatile fraction of chemicals in hoopoe preen secretions, and, by means of experimental antibiotic injections, test whether symbiotic bacteria living within the uropygial gland are responsible for their production. Hoopoes produce two different kinds of secretions that differ drastically in their chemical composition. While the malodorous dark secretions produced by nestlings included a complex mix of volatiles, these chemicals did not appear in white secretions produced by non-nesting birds. All volatiles detected showed strong antibacterial activity, and a mixture of the chemicals at the concentrations measured in nestling glands inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains assayed. We found support for the hypothesized role of bacteria in the production of such antimicrobial chemicals because experimental clearance of bacteria from glands of nestlings with antibiotics resulted in secretions without most of the volatiles detected in control individuals. Thus, the presence of symbiotic bacteria in the uropygial gland provides hoopoes with potent antimicrobials for topical use. Â© 2009 The Royal Society.",120,2,excluded,No green nest material

In Valais, a stronghold of this species in the country, the birds breed in intensively managed vineyards and show a preference for parcels with ground vegetation during territory establishment. As a ground-breeder, the species is highly vulnerable to nest predation by avian and mammal predators. The aims of our study were firstly to investigate nest site preferences of the woodlark within vineyards and secondly to compare the predation risk of artificial nests dependent of ground vegetation structure. Our results point out that the Woodlark prefers patches of tall and dense ground cover within vegetated vineyard parcels and avoids parcels that have been treated with herbicides. In a follow-up experiment we conducted a study comparing the predation rate of artificial nests between bare parcels (<20\% vegetated area) and vegetated parcels (>40\% vegetated area). Artificial nests equipped with one quail egg were distributed pairwise between two adjacent parcels that fulfilled the upper criteria and were monitored by trail cameras during 10-12 days. Predation rate was generally low (4 predation events) and only occurred in bare parcels. These data indicate that conspicuousness of avian nests may be decreased in vegetated parcels and that the amount of vegetation can lower the predation risk on ground breeding birds another indication for the importance of ground vegetation for a successful conservation of the endangered Woodlark in Swiss vineyards.

It accounts for spatio-temporal heterogeneity at population and landscape scales.We identify and quantify the potential exposure to 179 ASs of 140 clutches during pre-laying, laying, and incubation phases, and of 75 coveys. The data come from a large scale field study combining radiotelemetry and a farmer survey. They were collected in 12 different representative sites.The proportion of clutches potentially exposed to a given chemical was â‰¥5% for 32 ASs; prothioconazole and epoxiconazole ranking first. 71% of clutches were potentially exposed to â‰¥1 AS and 67% to â‰¥2 ASs. Mixtures involved 2 to 22 ASs. They emerged from commercial formulations, tank mixtures, bird habitat use, and combinations. ASs were fungicides (53%), herbicides (25%), and insecticides (16%) used on a variety of crops in April-June, when ground-nesting birds are breeding.

Furthermore, adults were yellower than nestlings, and for both groups the males were yellower than the females. Experimental interchange of eggs between nests showed that the variation in plumage colour observed between broods was related primarily to the food and not to genetic differences. Sampling, by the neckâ€�collar method, of the food brought by the parent birds showed that the yellower nestlings received a greater proportion of lepidopteran larvae, in particular greenishâ€�coloured ones, than did the nestlings with a paler plumage. A speculation is whether or not the variation in plumage colour has some adaptive value (viz. background matching).

Shells of snails are the principal source of calcium for female parids and some other passerines during egg formation. Shortages in the availability of snail shells may lead to laying smaller eggs with thinner shells. In urban green spaces that require protection against pests, the numbers of snails may become greatly reduced in response to molluscicide treatments. The use of a molluscicide treatment against pest slugs in the Botanic Garden, LÃ³dz, Poland, in 2013 and 2014 provided a unique quasi-experimental setting to study the effect of molluscicide on both non-target snails and Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus eggs. Using a forest study site where no treatment was applied as a control area, we tested for effects of the molluscicide treatment in the Botanic Garden on the density of snails and on the egg volume of Blue Tits. We found that after the molluscicide treatment a dramatic drop in snail numbers occurred, which likely restricted the availability of snail shells for egg laying Blue Tits in the Botanic Garden. Correspondingly, egg sizes significantly decreased in the Garden, while they stayed constant over time in the forest. Eggs in bigger clutches were more strongly affected by the molluscicide treatment than eggs in smaller clutches. Our quasi-experimental study suggests that Blue Tits are sensitive to poor availability of snail shells. This is manifested by laying smaller eggs, which require less calcium to be incorporated in the eggshell, in response to a dramatic drop in the availability of snail shells. This result is expected to raise awareness of potential indirect and inadvertent effects of park pest management on biota other than molluscan pests. Â© Polish Academy of Sciences.

In birds, parents have been shown to invest more into egg production and nestling care when paired with an attractive rather than an unattractive mate, as predicted by the differential allocation hypothesis. Here we investigate variation in the female's and male's share of incubation behaviour, a vital, and costly, period of parental care during which the embryo is vulnerable to perturbations in developmental conditions. We manipulated the attractiveness of male zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, using red or green leg-rings. To simulate their natural social environment we allowed them to breed in outdoor aviaries. All males within an aviary were given the same coloured ring to avoid ring-colour related assortative mating. Males within a colony, however, were still expected to show some variation in attractiveness with the earliest laying females possibly pairing with the most attractive males. Indeed we found that both factors played a role in explaining female incubation effort. Among females mated to red ringed males, earlier laying females contributed significantly more to incubation than late laying females, but no such pattern was found in females mated to green ringed males. Overall, there were no differences in the level of incubation provided by both parents between treatment groups, suggesting some compensation within the pair. Hatching success was correlated with a pair's total incubation effort. These results suggest that variation in the division of parental care between the sexes is in agreement with both increased effort of females mated with attractive males, and females compensating for the reduced effort of attractive males seeking further mating opportunities. These two factors can act at the same time in natural populations and both should be considered when explaining variation in division of labour between the sexes.

As previously reported, cells derived from human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) or human bone marrow (BM) under certain in vivo or in vitro conditions can manifest neural features that resemble features of neural-derived cells, immunocytochemically and in some instances also morphologically. The present study explored how hematopoietic-derived cells would respond to neurogenic signals from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult and aged (6 and 16 months old) rats. The mononuclear fraction of HUCB cells was transplanted into the SVZ of immunosuppressed (single cyclosporin or three-drug treatment) animals. The triple-suppression paradigm allowed us to protect transplanted human cells within the brain and to explore further their phenotypic and migratory properties. One week after implantation, many surviving HUCB cells were located within the SVZ and the vertical limb of the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The migration of HUCB cells was restricted exclusively to the pathway leading to the olfactory bulb. In younger animals, grafted cells navigated almost halfway through the vertical limb, whereas, in the older animals, the migration was less pronounced. The overall cell survival was greater in younger animals than in older ones. Immunocytochemistry for surface CD antigen expression showed that many HUCB cells, either cultured or within the brain parenchyma, retained their hematopoietic identity. A few cells, identified by using human-specific antibodies (anti-human nuclei, or mitochondria) expressed nestin and doublecortin, markers of endogenous neural progenitors. Therefore, it is believed that the environment of the neurogenic SVZ, even in aged animals, was able to support survival, "" neuralization,"" and migratory features of HUCB-derived cells.

Song activity, nest-box occupation, the carrying of green nesting materials into a nest hole (typical mate-attraction behaviors), and aggression occur much more frequently in males who also have higher testosterone (T)-levels than females. Here, we examined whether male-like concentrations of T would activate these behaviors in female Starlings. We treated females with implants that were either empty (C-females) or packed with T (T-females) during late December. Although elevated T-levels significantly increased song activity in females, the proportion of time spent singing was still much lower than in males. T-treatment in females also failed to induce singing behavior in the nest box, a typical male mate-attraction behavior. Those results suggest both activational and organizational effects of T on singing. Nest-box occupation, carrying of green nesting material into a nest hole, and aggressive behavior were not activated by elevated T-levels, indicating that sex differences in these behaviors are probably based on early organizational effects of steroid hormones. We also evaluated effects of increased T-concentrations on some physiological, morphological, and immunological parameters. T-treatment strongly suppressed tail feather regrowth after experimental plucking, and also delayed onset of molt of wing feathers and slowed its progress.

Although many species of plants recruit ants to obtain protection from herbivores, myrmecophily is rare, since only few plant species are known to be adapted for pollination predominantly by ants. The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the â€˜ant-pollination syndromeâ€™ including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services.

To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator-prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator-prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development.",55,1,excluded,No green nest material

The native North American bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is such a species, and pre-incubation quail eggs may experience temperatures â‰¥45Â°C. Yet, almost nothing is known about embryonic survival after such high pre-incubation temperatures. Freshly laid bobwhite quail eggs were exposed during a 12 day pre-incubation period to one of five thermal regimes: low oscillating temperatures (25â€“40Â°C, mean = 28.9Â°C), high oscillating temperatures (30â€“45Â°C, mean = 33.9Â°C), low constant temperatures (28.85Â°C), high constant temperatures (mean = 33.9Â°C), or commercially employed pre-incubation temperatures (20Â°C). After treatment, eggs were then incubated at a standard 37.5Â°C to determine subsequent effects on embryonic development rate, survival, water loss, hatching, and embryonic oxygen consumption. Both quantity of heating degree hours during pre-incubation and specific thermal regime (oscillating vs. non-oscillating) profoundly affected important aspects of embryo survival and indices of development and growth Pre-incubation quail eggs showed a remarkable tolerance to constant high temperatures (up to 45Â°C), surviving for 4.5Â±0.3 days of subsequent incubation, but high oscillating pre-incubation temperature increased embryo survival (mean survival 12.2Â±1.8 days) and led to more rapid development than high constant temperature (maximum 38.5Â°C), even though both groups experienced the same total heating degree-hours. Oxygen consumption was ~200â€“300 Î¼l O2.egg.min-1 at hatching in all groups, and was not affected by pre-incubation conditions. Oscillating temperatures, which are the norm for pre-incubation quail eggs in their natural habitat, thus enhanced survival at higher temperatures. However, a 5Â°C increase in pre-incubation temperature, which equates to the predicted long-term increases of 5Â°C or more, nonetheless reduced hatching rate by approximately 50%. Thus, while preincubation bobwhite eggs may be resiliant to moderate oscillating temperature increases, global warming will likely severely impact wild bobwhite quail populations, especially in their strongholds in southern latitudes.

More than half of all Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus occurred in the absence of Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis during nesting and post-hatching periods compared to c. 20\% when concentrated by pre-breeding snow cover. In contrast, only 5\% of Barnacle Geese were observed in the absence of Pink-footed Geese pre-breeding, 15\% during nesting, and 35\% post-hatching. Among six defined habitat types, Barnacle Geese resorted more to `upland' habitats during pre-breeding and nesting and to lowland lakes post-hatching when compared to Pink-footed Geese. Although Pink-footed Geese showed less change in seasonal habitat preference, many shifted to the river valley bottom post-hatching, giving access to open water (predator avoidance) and lush green vegetation (foraging for goslings). The smallest extent of distributional overlap between the two species occurred post-hatching, but each species was also highly restricted by snow cover during pre-nesting. The greatest extent of overlap in distribution and diet occurred during incubation, when large dietary variation between different breeding valleys reflected local food availability around nests (probably a result of nest-site preference rather than food selection per se). Whether this means that increased interactions within and between the two goose species with future increases in local density are most likely to be manifest at this stage of the summer is impossible to determine without knowledge of available food resources and manipulative experiments. More detailed investigations of the effects of foraging by both species on plant structure, quality and community composition are necessary to predict likely outcomes of future changes in population densities of both species.",26,2,excluded,Not experimental

The following year, a further outbreak in the same aviary occurred in a different flock of goldfinches. At the time of the second outbreak, dead and sick common sparrows (Passer domesticus) discovered near the aviary were also found to have systemic isosporosis. Method: The systemic isosporosis was investigated and described using histopathology, electron microscopy and sequence analysis of the 18s gene. Results: Isospora spp. infecting the greenfinch and the goldfinch caused significant thickening of the duodenal lamina propria. Measurements in the goldfinches showed an inverse correlation coefficient between the thickening of the duodenum and the weightof the birds. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of Isospora spp. within lymphocytes migrating into the lamina propria of the duodenum. Analysis of the 18s sequence discovered two different gene sequences across the three species of birds that didn't completely match any sequences previously deposited in GenBank. Conclusion: Although the sparrows were found to have died from causes other than systemic Isospora, molecular studies of samples from their liver revealed the presence of an Isospora with 18s gene sequence identical to that found in the captive greenfinches.

However, the morphology of RGL stem cells remains poorly described. Here, we used light microscopy and electron microscopy to examine Nestin-GFP transgenic mice and provide a detailed ultrastructural reconstruction analysis of Nestin- GFP-positive RGL cells of the dentate gyrus.

However, there are limitations with their use related to the availability, immunogenicity, and uncertainty of the mechanisms involved. To address these issues, definitive NSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated using a nonviral, piggyBac transposon approach, were investigated. Committed NSCs were generated from iPS cells using a free-floating neurosphere methodology previously described by our laboratory. To delineate the mechanism of action, specifically the role of exogenous myelination, NSCs derived from wildtype (wt) and nonmyelinating Shiverer (shi) iPS cell lines were used following thoracic SCI with subacute intraspinal transplantation. Behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological outcomes wereanalyzedtoassess the effectivenessof this treatment. Thewt- andshi-iPS-NSCswere validatedand shown to be equivalent except in myelination capacity. Both iPS-NSC lines successfully integrated into the injured spinal cord and predominantly differentiated to oligodendrocytes, but only the wt-iPS-NSC treatment resulted in a functional benefit. The wt-iPS-dNSCs, which exhibited the capacity for remyelination, significantly improved neurobehavioral function (BassoMouse Scale and CatWalk), histological outcomes, and electrophysiological measures of axonal function (sucrose gap analysis) compared with the nonmyelinating iPS-dNSCs and cell-free controls. In summary, we demonstrated that iPS cells can generate translationally relevant NSCs for applications in SCI.

I evaluated these hypotheses by studying predation on artificial song thrush (Turdus philomelos) nests with quail eggs, painted either white, blue, or spotted (cryptic to a human eye). Corvids were the major nest predators. For concealed as well as exposed nests, I found no differences in the predation rates of nests with white, blue, or spotted eggs. Predators apparently detected the nests, and not the eggs, first. In a second experiment, I placed egg groups without nests in trees to study the effect of color per se.

For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95\% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18.

In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants in blue tit nests affect physiological condition of nestlings as indicated by hemoglobin and glucose in the blood. Nestlings in nests supplemented with fresh, aromatic plants had elevated blood hemoglobin, and therefore improved physiological condition, as compared with control nestlings. There was no difference between nestlings in two contrasting habitats (urban parkland and forest). Although mean levels of blood glucose did not differ between treatment and control nestlings, the blood of forest nestlings contained more glucose than the blood of parkland nestlings, which indicates poorer health for forest nestlings. In general, knowledge of the effects of incorporating fresh green, aromatic plant material into avian nests on physiological condition of nestlings is still fragmentary and more experimental studies are needed. Significance statement: The blue tit is one of a few known passerine birds that incorporate fresh fragments of aromatic plants in their nest during the nesting period. Little is known about the impact of this material on nestling body condition, and there is a need to understand this behavior and its effects.

Two populations on different sides of the migratory divide were studied; one which flies in a SE direction in autumn and one which flies in a SW direction. The populations were from Lake Constance in the F.R.G. and Lake Neusiedl in Austria. Directional preference during fall migratory restlessness was determined by using Emlen funnels.

One can conclude from these results that there are populationâ€�specific differences in the innate directional preferences of fall migratory restlessness. A number of possibilities are discussed as causes for the extreme westward orientation of the birds from Lake Constance: The WSW orientation of the Alps could be genetically programmed into the pattern of migration. It could have been the result of a compensation for the transport from Lake Constance to Lake Neusiedl and therefore explained by goal area navigation.

Initial work focused on the causes and consequences of the extreme hatching asynchrony exhibited by parrotlets. Examining an exhaustive set of fitness correlates at experimentally synchronized or asynchronized nests found no evidence that asynchrony benefited hatching patterns. The consequences of not caring for eggs during laying were severe, as unincubated eggs lost their viability rapidly and eggs left in unguarded nests were frequently destroyed by nonbreeding pairs. Work over the past decade has focused on understanding parrotlet social system and population dynamics. Parrotlets have a complex social system composed of male-female nesting pairs, nonbreeding male-female pairs, male-male pairs, and nonbreeding males occurring primarily alone or in groups that sometimes molest breeders. Nonbreeders composed up to 50\% of the males that are resighted during years when populations are large. Extra pair fertilizations were uncommon (< 8\% of young). Divorce rarely occurs in breeding pairs, but pairs typically breed together for only 1-2 years. Male-male pairs were young individuals that traveled together, allopreened each other, and entered nest boxes together. Parrotlets have strong site fidelity and form two breeding populations connected by dispersing juveniles. The two sites are 600 in apart, but differ in elevation by 1-2 m, in soil type, and flooding regime. These differences can result in differences of up to 6 weeks in the onset of nesting in rainy years, but not in dry years.

ADSCs transduced with lentivirus were able to generate NSC-like cells, without any effects on their growth, phenotype, and normal differentiation potential. NSC-like cells derived from ADSCs formed neurospheres and expressed high levels of the neural progenitor marker nestin. In the absence of selected growth factors, these neurospheres differentiated into neurons expressing NeuN and MAP2 and GFAP-expressing glia, as determined by immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Here we examined the decade-long response of diurnal breeding birds to a VRH experiment that, for the first time, incorporated both overstory and shrub layer treatments in red pine (Pines resinosa) dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Overstory treatments included dispersed retention, aggregated retention achieved by cutting small (0.1 ha) gaps, aggregated retention achieved by cutting large (0.3 ha) gaps, and an uncut control. A shrub layer treatment of ambient or reduced shrub density was also implemented as a split-plot design in each harvest treatment. We found a consistent increase in bird species richness and abundance with all retention harvest treatments over time compared to the control; species richness was also significantly greater in the large gap-aggregated treatment compared to dispersed and small gap-aggregated retention harvests. Among guilds, foliage-gleaning and shrub- and tree-nesting birds exhibited the strongest positive response to retention harvesting. Species associated with early-successional habitat, forest edges, and shrubs responded most positively to VRH including Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica) and American Restart (S. ruticilla), although late-successional species such as Blackburnian Warbler (S. fusca) and Black-throated Green Warbler (S.

Three measurements were compared between different tests from A to C. The result of the experiment indicated that the density of CO2 was reduced from 2000 to 600 ppm in 5.37 hours of test C. In average, the efficiency of CO2 adsorption was 1.38ppm/hr each plant. The indoor temperature decreased to 2.5 ? and relative humidity increased about 2~4%. We concluded that Bird's-Nest Fern had superior properties to CO2 adsorption, temperature and humidity conditioning to indoor air quality improvement.",260,2,excluded,Not birds

We tested adult starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) for their physiological capacity and behavioural ability to detect and discriminate between volatiles emitted from plant material. Multi-unit electrophysiological recordings from olfactory nerves of adults indicated that strong responses were reliably elicited by volatiles from six plant species. After pairings of plant volatiles with gastro-intestinal malaise, birds exhibited conditioned avoidance in behavioural experiments, and made all possible pairwise discriminations between volatiles of the various plant species. Bilateral olfactory nerve cuts prior to conditioning abolished the ability to acquire avoidance, suggesting that olfactory cues mediated the response to plant species. These and previous results suggest that starlings use volatile cues to discriminate and choose between plants used in nest construction. Â© 1987.",364,1,selected,

The effects of this exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new and control-impact radiation treatment is used. In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of ``non-plant{''} indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests over ground. To detect ecological responses that occur for the first year since a herbaceous community has been exposed to potentially bioactive RF-EMF, the first two indicators groups should be used.",56,1,excluded,No birds

They show these plants to females to catch their attention before they incorporate them into their nests. Nestlings reared in nests containing herbs carry fewer bacteria, have higher haematocrit levels and more basophile leucocytes, and have a higher fledging weight than those reared in nests without herbs. The incubation temperature is higher in nests with herbs than in herbless nests. Females are attracted by herb nests and herb nests provide energy-saving benefits to incubating females. In choice experiments, starlings employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can only discriminate odours during the reproductive season. The association between odour perception and reproductive behaviour suggests that increased testosterone production, related to the increasing photoperiod in spring, may guide these seasonal changes. The size of the olfactory bulb but not its ability to discriminate was affected by testosterone implants in the non-reproductive season.

However, the consequences of this behaviour for the females are still poorly known. In this study, we evaluated the behavioural responses of female Spotless Starlings to the green plants that they find in their nests. We added green plants to a group of experimental nests (E nests) and quantified the activity of the nesting females in the E nests and in a group of non-manipulated nests (C nests). The females never added green plants to their nests, but they removed the green plants more frequently from the E nests than from the C nests. The number of departures from the nest by females that carried green plants was positively correlated with the number of visits by females that carried nothing. In contrast, the number of departures by females carrying green plants was uncorrelated with the number of visits made by females that carried nest-building materials. These results suggest that the females made a specific additional effort to remove the green plants from the E nests. We propose that this behaviour may be an adaptive response of mated females that serves to counteract the eventual negative effects of green plants on their reproductive success. However, competing hypotheses cannot be rejected, and additional work is needed to better understand the removal of green plants by female Spotless Starlings. Â© 2011 Dt.

Occupancy status of the boxes and reproductive parameters of the birds were recorded and analyzed. Occupancy rate of red boxes was compared to the average of the boxes in other colors pooled together. The occupancy rate of red nest-boxes was significantly higher than the average of all other colors combined for year 2007 (Ï‡2 =5. 51,df =1,0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05), 2008 (Ï‡2 =5. 51,df =1, 0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05) and 2010 (Ï‡2 =4. 65,df =1,0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05).

All these indicate that great tits do prefer the red-color nest boxes to the boxes of other colors. For breeding efficiency, there was no significant difference in clutch size among boxes of different colors in each year. The clutch size of red nest boxes was numerically lower than each of the other colors in 2010, but for the rest of the years it was numerically higher.

Hippocampal slices prepared from young rodent pups have served as a popular model for studying the pathways by which astrocytes participate in synaptic transmission. It is, however, not known how well astrocytes tolerate traumatic injury and hypoxia, which are unavoidable when preparing acute slices. We here showed that astrocytes exhibit striking changes in expression of several receptors and structural proteins, including re-expression of the developmental marker nestin within 90 min following preparation of live vibratome slices. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy showed a 2.7-fold loss of astrocytic processes in acute hippocampal slices prepared from glial fibrillary acidic protein-green fluorescent protein reporter mice. A sharp decrease in the number of mitochondria was also noted in acute slices, concurrently with an increase in mitochondrial size. Glycogen content decreased 3-fold upon slice preparation and did not recover despite stable recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic current. Analysis of Ca2+ signaling showed that astrocytic responses to purine receptor and mGluR5 agonists differed in slice versus in vivo. These observations suggest that the functional properties and the fine structure of astrocytes in slices may be reflective of early stages of reactive gliosis and should be confirmed in vivo when possible.

Previous studies indicated grazing showed various impacts on small rodents; however, most studies were conducted over 1â€“2Â years without controlling for confounding factors such as immigration/emigration and predation in rodents. Brandtâ€™s voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010â€“2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandtâ€™s voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandtâ€™s voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the following 3Â years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity. Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total phenol content). Our findings highlight the urgent need for more flexible management of yearly rotational grazing to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.

Exogenous factors, such as daylength, can also exert a measure of control: photoperiodic cues detected by birds that hatch late in the season induce accelerated juvenile development, assuring that late-hatched young migrate at the same time as early-hatched young. Whether these same mechanisms of control also apply to birds that migrate between breeding and nonbreeding areas entirely within the tropics at latitudes characterized by little seasonal variation in photoperiod is unknown. We conducted a common-garden experiment in Panama (9degreesN) in which we hand-reared wild-caught nestling yellow-green vireos, Vireo flavoviridis, under a constant photoperiod and monitored them for the expression of juvenile moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity. Even in the absence of a seasonal photoperiodic cue, juveniles moulted, accumulated fat reserves and initiated migratory activity, suggesting endogenous control of these processes. Age at the onset of moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity were each significantly negatively correlated with hatch date, however, so that the expression of these three processes was synchronized among juveniles with respect to the time of the season. We suggest that the slight differences in daylength perceived either by the nestlings themselves in the short time before they were collected (at 6-8 days of age) or by the adult females during egg production influenced rate of nestling development, thus allowing later-hatched young to moult, accumulate fat and migrate at a younger age than early-hatched young.

When there is doping (n â‰  0), the phase transition is metal-semimetal, the gap appears at a wave vector that is different from the Fermi-wave vector and an incommensurate structural phase transition takes place. This phase transition plays an important role in the formation of electron (or hole) bags, in the considerable increase of carrier DOS near the Fermi level and in the change of Cooper pair wave character that may lead to enhancement of superconducting TC in Quasi-two dimensional (Q2D) materials. The start of our study is that when the doping n is different from zero the nesting vector is different from (Ï€,Ï€) and defined by minimizing the energy of the system. By the method of Green â€˜s functions for the charge density wave and the Cooper pair we found a system of equations describing the phase.transition properties of Q2D materials, including superconductivity.

By exploiting landscape-scale spatial heterogeneity in areas of primary productivity across alpine tundra ecotones and supplied with experimental nests in sub-Arctic Scandinavia, we found that predation risk indeed increased with primary productivity. The productivity-predation risk relation was independent of the simultaneous effects of rodent population dynamics and vegetation cover at nest sites.

Only bowerâ€�birds make bowers. The bower is on the ground and has no direct connexion with the nest, which is built in a tree that may be some hundreds of yards away. At each bower is a displayâ€�ground which the owner strews with coloured flowers, fruit and shells, or, in some species, pallid or reflecting articles. These, contrary to general belief, are selected with great discrimination. Members of three genera paint their bowers with fruitâ€�pulp, or with charcoal or comminuted dry grass mixed with saliva. Catâ€�birds, on the other hand, do not erect a special structure. Pioneer nineteenthâ€�century naturalists, who knew little about bowerâ€�birds, ascribed a courtship function to the above activities and postulated an aesthetic sense as well. During the last three decades, however, there has arisen a school of Australian naturalists, which, though admitting that the displays of bowerâ€�birds may have had their origins in sexual utilitarianism, believe that this has become a minor factor. They hold that modern bowerâ€�birds are intelligent, consciously aesthetic, and that they carry out their complex display activities essentially for relaxation or recreation. This theory is here rejected. Experimental work has shown that gonadectomy inhibits display and bowerâ€�building and that injections of testosterone reâ€�establishes it. Postâ€�nuptial (outâ€�ofâ€�season) display occurs after the seasonal metamorphosis of the testes and the rehabilitation of the interstitium, and is of the same nature as the autumnal display of other birds. Excluding one monospecific genus (Archboldia) of whose bower only fragmentary knowledge is available, true bowerâ€�birds appear to fall into two distinct groups. These are (i) the avenueâ€�builders (Ptilonorhynchus, Chlamydera, Sericulus) (Fig. i) and (2) the maypoleâ€�builders (Prionodura, Amblyornis) (Fig. 2). The avenueâ€�builders are widespread throughout both Australia and New Guinea. Each lays down a foundation platform of twigs, and in this wedges twin parallel walls of twigs which sometimes arch overhead. At one, or sometimes both, ends of the bower the male birds arrange their displayâ€�things. One species replaces the terminal displayâ€�grounds with two additional walls which are built at right angles to the original ones. It thus achieves three avenues, in all of which it places decorations. Among avenueâ€�builders the male builds a bower early in the season, after which it attracts a female to the bower and there displays to it at the focal point of its territory. The male rapidly achieves spermatogenesis but the female cycle lags behind. The male displays (â€˜dancesâ€™) for several months, while the female remains passively in waiting. During this lengthy period of androgen liberation there occurs the remarkable display of bowerâ€�painting, vocal mimicry of other birds, and the insatiable collection of coloured or otherwise distinctive displayâ€�things. In one, and possibly several, species the collected displayâ€�objects are coloured similarly to the watching female. With these in his beak the male displays energetically and often violently but does not approach the female. This has led to published references to â€˜sexual fetishismâ€™ in bowerâ€�birds. There is, however, a fundamental difference between the above normal and constant avian activity and a form of psychopathic sexual behaviour in man. Likewise, although the male bowerâ€�birds' prolonged preoccupation with displayâ€�objects while he is in a breeding condition involves a form of sexual sublimation, it is important to remember that this too is normal and constant and a means towards, rather than a sublimation of, reproductive efficiency. The display with the ornaments before the watching female continues unabated until the forest becomes seasonally full of the special protein food on which the young are fed. Then only is the male's physical attention transferred from his displayâ€�things to the waiting female. The female now leaves the bower, alone to build the nest and to rear the young. The male continues his display. His testes, unlike those of most birds, do not metamorphose after the young appear. Thus he remains potentially polygamous, although polygamy has not been proved. In ascribing an essentially utilitarian function to the bower and associated activities, it is not suggested that bowerâ€�birds do not enjoy their extraordinary performances. Further, it is emphasized that bowerâ€�birds appear to have developed their display beyond the bounds of strict utilitarianism, since some individuals successfully reproduce without painting their bowers, and it has been experimentally shown that reproduction (in the aviary without competition) can take place in the absence of coloured decorations. The maypoleâ€�builders, with one exception, are confined to the dense rainâ€�forests of New Guinea. The fundamental maypole structures are a central growing sapling with a cone of fabric packed around its base. One species, measuring only 9I inches long, extends this cone to a height of about nine feet. Another species surmounts a dwarf cone with a conical, waterproof hut. A third builds over the cone a hemispherical hut fronted by a stockade, and a fourth surmounts the basal cone with a cylinder of moss and fibre which extends up the basic sapling. Fruits, flowers, beetles' wingâ€�cases and other coloured objects are used to decorate various parts of the structures or their surroundings. Bowerâ€�building of both avenue and maypole types probably originated as a form of displacement activity. The males as well as the females of most passerine birds possess an inherent urge to build nests. Toâ€�day only female bowerâ€�birds seem to build nests. These are built of twigs. The males, on the other hand, have taken to building twig bowers on the displayâ€�ground. Here they spend much of their time during the sexual season. The displayâ€�ground is the focal point of their activity, and, together with the female, of their interest. Nestâ€�building among females is essentially controlled by the seasonal liberation of hormones. The same appears to be true of male bowerâ€�building. In short, nestâ€�building is of a bisexual nature, and this has made possible bowerâ€�construction as a displaced building drive, the new product of which has become valuable, ritualized and permanent in the course of the evolution of each species. Bowerâ€�painting is a displaced form of the courtship feeding that is widespread among passerine and other birds. Instead of projecting this attention on the watching female the male does so on his bower which, along with its decorations, is his chief physical preoccupation (apart from feeding and threat) during the weeks or months of spermatogenesis. Of the three catâ€�birds, two greenish species indulge in arboreal displays in much the same manner as other passerine birds, whilst the third, the brown stagemaker of tropical Queensland, has taken partly to the rainâ€�forest floor. Here it clears a space on the ground and covers this with fresh leaves which it cuts each morning by means of a â€˜toothedâ€™ beak. The leaves are placed with paler underâ€�surfaces uppermost, thus creating the more striking effect against the dark earth. From a singingâ€�stick above the decorated stage the bird calls loudly and continuously and thus advertises its presence and its decorated stage to every potential mate or rival within many hundreds of yards. The precise function of the stage is unknown, but the scanty available data suggest that it, and the vocal display from above, are means toward the cementing of the pairâ€�bond and effecting the synchronization of the joint sexual processes of the pair. Finally, perhaps, it is the mating place when the monsoon begins and brings with it the seasonal harvest of insect food on which the young will be fed. It has been suggested by cabinetâ€�workers that â€˜bowerâ€�building has been developed coincidentally or perhaps independentlyâ€™ (Iredale, 1950) and â€˜seems to be imitativeâ€™ and not indicative of close relationship (Mathews, 1926). This view is rejected. It is believed that the study of bowerâ€�birds as living animals shows that they fall into two distinct families, each of whose members are much closer allied than has been thought. The catâ€�birds probably form a family by themselves. Cnemophilus, first considered to be a birdâ€�ofâ€�paradise, and next a bowerâ€�bird, should be reinstated to its original classification.

Since fallows provide key resources for birds within the agricultural matrix, such as nesting sites, shelter and forage, complete understanding of the effect of field-management strategies on vegetation structure and food is essential to fulfill bird requirements and improve habitat management. In this study we experimentally compare the most common field practices (ploughing, shredding, herbicide application and cover cropping) on fallow lands by assessing the resources they provide for birds in terms of vegetation structure and food resources (leaf and seed availability), as well as the economic costs of their implementation. Fallow management treatments are ranked for six target species in a lowland area of the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, according to the available information on their requirements. The different agronomic practices offer various quantities and types of resources, highlighting the importance of fallow management in bird conservation. Shredding and early herbicide application (February) are estimated to be good practices for Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and Calandra Lark (Melanocorypha calandra), providing both favorable habitat and foraging conditions, while being economical. Meanwhile, superficial tillage in spring is found to be optimum for the rest of the species tested, despite being among the poorest food providers. Alternating patches of the best treatments would improve the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes by maximizing the harboring habitat for the endangered species.

We tested effects of 5 levels of operational plantation establishment intensity on vegetation communities and structure important for bobwhite in 1-5-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations (n = 4) in the Outer Coastal Plain Mixed Forest of Mississippi. We compared results with values reported in the literature to calculate usable space for winter food, loafing, nesting, and brood-rearing at 2 levels of spatial resolution. Treatments (k = 5) reflected a range of management intensities and were combinations of mechanical site preparation, chemical site preparation (CSP), and herbaceous weed control (HWC). Coverage of winter food plants in the least intensive treatment was more than double that in the most intensive; however, differences in usable space of winter food cover were negligible due to improved accessibility in more intensive treatments. Although CSP reduced coverage of nonpine woody plants across all years, loafing cover reached adequate levels by year 3 in all treatments. Usable nesting cover was <4\% across all years and treatments and was nearly eliminated by the reduction in herbaceous cover and visual screening cover following broadcast HWC. Optimal brood-rearing habitat was virtually absent in all treatments and years due to the lack of conjoint occurrence of bare ground and forb canopy. Although bobwhite habitat may have been promoted by formerly widespread plantation establishment methods that involved wide-scale soil disturbance, those established using newer methods with less soil disturbance are likely inadequate for most bobwhite habitat requirements. Efforts to provide bobwhite habitat in plantation-dominated landscapes may have to rely on management of thinned mid-rotation stands and permanent landscape features such as rights-of-way. The value of young plantations for bobwhite may be increased by reducing management intensity or increasing spacing between planting rows, thus increasing time before crown closure and providing opportunity for understory manipulations.",118,2,excluded,No green nest material

The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57\% for adult males, 41\% for adult females, and 12\% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.",139,2,excluded,No green nest material

J.",BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,80,NA,30-39,2015,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.09.010,"Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerberg) Morelet is a pathogenic fungus that causes severe damage in coniferous forests, causing the death of the trees, in Central and Northern Europe, North America and Japan. Biological control (i.e. the use of biologically antagonistic organisms) is being considered as an alternative and an eco-friendly method to deal with plant diseases. Among such organisms several fungal endophytes have been successfully used to reduce or inhibit the growth of pathogens. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of several fungal endophytes to reduce the G. abietina spreading on pine seedlings, with the goal of exploring the mechanisms involved in that reduction. The experiment was carried out on two-year old Pinus halepensis seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Five fungal endophytes (Trichoderma spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Aureobasidium spp., endophyte 20.1 and Leotiomycete spp.) obtained from healthy P. halepensis trees were used to evaluate their effect on six G. abietina isolates. The pathogen and the endophyte were both inoculated in every seedling. At the end of the experiment seedlings were cut and brought to the laboratory where the necrosis length and total phenol content of the plant were measured. The pathogen presence was determined by a nested PCR with specific primers of G. abietina. The presence of all endophytes significantly reduced the necrosis length caused by G. abietina in most of the cases. However, the phenolic content of the plant, which is an indicator of the activation of the plant's defence mechanisms, had not increased with the endophyte inoculation. Therefore, the reduction in the necrosis observed could be attributed to a direct effect of the endophyte on the Gremmeniella spreading. These results suggest that the use of fungal endophytes could be an effective way to protect against G. abietina infections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",87,2,excluded,Not birds

Zhalong Nature Reserve is one of the main breeding sites of the western group red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) migratory population, with a large, dynamic breeding population. With the objective of predicting the nesting habitat of red-crowned crane in Zhalong Nature Reserve, we obtained nesting occurrence records for this species from the study area collected from 2012-2013, extracted the environmental factors from the thematic mapper (TM) image of Zhalong Nature Reserve in 2013. We analyzed the nesting habitat suitability of red-crowned crane by the combined use of a GIS and MAXENT model. The results showed that the accuracy of the MAXENT model was excellent (training data area under the curve=0.901). The greenness vegetation index (34.9%), man-made interference (namely, the distance to frequently disturbed zones from human activity, 17.1%), soil wetness index (16.3%), and elevation (15.7%) were the main environmental factors influencing the nesting habitat selection of red-crowned crane. The central and south regions of the core zone were the main suitable nesting zones, and there was a small area of suitable habitat in the buffer zone and the experimental zone; the suitable nesting habitat area was 35857.35 hm2, representing about 17.07% of the whole reserve. The results showed that the core zone is the most important management zone for red-crowned crane nesting, and the reserve should also pay more attention to the small reed marsh area in the buffer zone and the experimental zone.

While there is some empirical support for this idea, both theory and observations question its validity. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the influence of egg color on male American robin Turdus migratorius behavior by replacing natural clutches with four artificial eggs that were all either pale or vividly colored, close to the extremes in natural egg coloration. At the end of the incubation period, three unrelated nestlings were fostered into each experimental nest, and parental provisioning behavior was monitored when nestlings were 3, 6, and 9 days old. Male provisioning rate for 3-day-old nestlings was significantly higher in the vivid egg treatment compared to both the pale egg treatment and untreated controls, but there was no effect of egg color on paternal behavior at the older nestling stages. Male feeding rate at unmanipulated nests was only weakly positively related to natural egg color (chroma) when nestlings were 3 days old. These results suggest that blue-green egg color may act as a post-mating signal of female quality or investment in this species, but our findings do not exclude the possibility that egg color pigmentation also serves other adaptive functions.

Here we study the effects of climate-driven environmental variation (i.e. vegetation greenness) and land-use (protected versus unprotected areas) on body condition of vulture nestlings in savannah landscapes. We combine ringing data on nestling measurements of two vultures (lappet-faced and African white-backed vulture) with land-use and environmental variables. We show that body condition of white-backed vulture nestlings decreased through the study period and was lowest inside protected areas. For the lappet-faced vulture, nestling condition was improved during harsh years with lower than average vegetation greenness assumed to result in increased ungulate mortality, but only within protected areas. Such interaction was not tested for the white-backed vulture due to collinearity. The species-specific effects of land-use and vegetation greenness on nestling condition of the two sympatric vulture species likely stem from their different life-histories, diet preferences and foraging behaviour. While translation of current findings on nestling conditions to their possible influence on population demography and species persistence require further studies, our findings demonstrate how environmental change may trigger selective bottom-up ecosystem responses in arid environments under global change.

They show these plants to females to catch their attention before they incorporate them into their nests. Nestlings reared in nests containing herbs carry fewer bacteria, have higher haematocrit levels and more basophile leucocytes, and have a higher fledging weight than those reared in nests without herbs. The incubation temperature is higher in nests with herbs than in herbless nests. Females are attracted by herb nests and herb nests provide energy-saving benefits to incubating females. In choice experiments, starlings employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can only discriminate odours during the reproductive season. The association between odour perception and reproductive behaviour suggests that increased testosterone production, related to the increasing photoperiod in spring, may guide these seasonal changes. The size of the olfactory bulb but not its ability to discriminate was affected by testosterone implants in the non-reproductive season.",19,1,selected,

However, the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of rare species are seldom examined and are poorly understood. I tested several explanations of landscape-scale rarity in the New England cobble beach plant community, an assemblage of halophytic forbs associated with fringing beds of the marine intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora. Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the cobble substrate, thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species. Frequencies of the presence of forb species behind 387 sampled Spartina beds distributed along 120 km of shoreline in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, ranged from 0.005 to 0.382. Both the whole forb assemblage and individual species were strongly nested with respect to patch size and species richness. Species that were rare on a landscape scale were generally only found behind the longest beds, and bed length was positively related to species diversity. Experimental seed additions to 40 beds ranging in length from 8 to 688 m indicated that intermediate-sized beds often occupied by common species are not habitable by three rare forbs. When present behind the longest beds, these rare species are always associated with a microhabitat characterized by a relatively fine-grained and highly stable substrate. A series of substrate manipulations combined with experimental seed additions indicated that the rare annuals Spergularia marina, Salicornia biglovii, and Atriplex arenaria are restricted to the longest Spartina beds because smaller beds lack suitable substrate. These experiments also suggest that seed supply, competitors, and herbivores are not the proximate causes of the absence of these species from smaller beds, although dispersal limitation may prevent the colonization of many larger habitable patches. The microhabitat required by the rare forbs appears to be generated by the deposition of fine-grained particles behind the center of the longest Spartina beds. Consequently, bed length is causally related to the distribution of populations at a landscape scale and to species richness and composition at the scale of a whole habitat patch.",33,2,excluded,Not birds

Such large-scale manipulations of a key element of most ecosystems offer unique opportunities to investigate how the loss of large carnivores affects communities, including the extent, if any, of interactions at different trophic levels. Here, we demonstrate a cascade of ecological events that were triggered by the local extinction of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) from the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These include (1) the demographic eruption of a large, semi-obligate, riparian-dependent herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), during the past 150 yr; (2) the subsequent alteration of riparian vegetation structure and density by ungulate herbivory; and (3) the coincident reduction of avian neotropical migrants in the impacted willow communities. We contrasted three sites matched hydrologically and ecologically in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA, where grizzly bears and wolves had been eliminated 60-75 yr ago and moose densities were about five times higher, with those on national forest lands outside the park, where predation by the two large carnivores has been replaced by human hunting and moose densities were lower. Avian species richness and nesting density varied inversely with moose abundance, and two riparian specialists, Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and MacGillivray's Warblers (Oporornis tolmiei), were absent from Park riparian systems where moose densities were high. Our findings not only offer empirical support for the top-down effect of large carnivores in terrestrial communities, but also provide a scientific rationale for restoration options to conserve biological diversity. To predict future impacts, whether overt or subtle, of past management, and to restore biodiversity, more must be known about ecological interactions, including the role of large carnivores. Restoration options with respect to the system that we studied in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are simple: (1) do nothing and accept the erosion of biological diversity, (2) replace natural carnivores with human predation, or (3) allow continued dispersal of grizzly bears and wolves into previously occupied, but now vacant, habitat. Although additional science is required to further our understanding of this and other terrestrial systems, a larger conservation challenge remains: to develop public support for ecologically rational conservation options.",162,2,excluded,Not empirical

These cycles have been disturbed as night-time darkness is increasingly replaced by artificial illumination. Investigating the physiological consequences of free-living organisms in artificially lit environments is crucial to determine whether nocturnal lighting disrupts circadian rhythms, changes behaviour, reduces fitness and ultimately affects population numbers. We make use of a unique, large-scale network of replicated field sites which were experimentally illuminated at night using lampposts emanating either red, green, white or no light to test effect on stress hormone concentrations (corticosterone) in a songbird, the great tit (Parus major). Adults nesting in white-light transects had higher corticosterone concentrations than in the other treatments. We also found a significant interaction between distance to the closest lamppost and treatment type: individuals in red light had higher corticosterone levels when they nested closer to the lamppost than individuals nesting farther away, a decline not observed in the green or dark treatment. Individuals with high corticosterone levels had fewer fledglings, irrespective of treatment. These results show that artificial light can induce changes in individual hormonal phenotype. As these effects vary considerably with light spectrum, it opens the possibility to mitigate these effects by selecting street lighting of specific spectra.

Why some birds add green plants to their nests has long puzzled biologists. Some studies suggest that this behavior is promoted by natural selection because of its positive effects on nestling health. However, if greenery functions as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness, it may promote costly female competition for preferred males. We experimentally increased the amount of plants in spotless starling's nests, causing a reduction in the number of recruits. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses, adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and recruitment success.",16,2,selected,

Then I report the results of egg replacement experiments that assess the relationship between egg rejection behavior and the difference in appearance between own and foreign eggs. Ruppell's weaver (Ploceus galbula) eggs are variable in appearance between individuals and consistent within a clutch, but vary widely in the distinctiveness of particular traits.

Egg ground color is bimodal, with a broad continuous class of off-white/UV eggs and another broad class of blue-green eggs. Variation in all other traits is unimodal and usually normal in distribution. Females reject foreign eggs on the basis of the difference in brightness of the ground color and spotting of foreign eggs relative to their own, and the difference in degree to which spots are aggregated at the broad end of the egg. This aggregation is among the most distinctive features of their eggs, but the brightness of the ground color and spotting brightness are not; the birds' use of brightness rather than the more distinctive chromatic variation to recognize eggs might reflect the salience of achromatic contrast in a dim enclosed nest.",47,1,excluded,No green nest material

We evaluated how brood size influenced nestling physiological (glucocorticoids) and somatic traits (growth), and the extent to which their relationship differed between two closely related, sympatric songbirds when experiencing identical rearing environments. Specifically, we used a cross-fostering approach to alter brood size and create an experimental gradient of nestmate competition, and then tested whether experimentally manipulated brood sizes resulted in nestlings with altered concentrations of corticosterone and whether corticosterone responses traded off with growth. Nestlings of both species experienced elevated concentrations of baseline and stressor-induced corticosterone when raised in enlarged broods, relative to control and reduced broods, but neither measurement was found to trade off with growth or be linked to survival to fledging. In contrast, we found divergence in the magnitude of the corticosterone stress response between species across all brood treatments, with greater stressor-induced corticosterone concentrations found in the Violet-green Swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) relative to the closely related Tree Swallow (T.Â bicolor). Our study demonstrated that brood size can lead to changes in offspring corticosterone concentrations in swallows and that nestlings of sympatric species, even those that are closely related and ecologically similar, can diverge in their corticosterone stress response when experiencing identical rearing conditions. We conclude that corticosterone appears to play a key role for balancing energetic demands that arise in the face of nestmate competition in Tachycineta swallows and that elevated concentrations of corticosterone may enhance offspring survival during challenging environmental conditions, such as when brood competition is strong.

These `trophic cascades' can be seriously disrupted by the local extinction of top predators. They can also be restored by the subsequent re-introduction of top predators by conservationists. Here, we investigated trophic cascades involving kaka, puriri moths and their host trees. New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis, Nestoridae) are large parrots that were extirpated from most of its range in the 20th century. Unlike most other parrots, kaka forage primarily by digging through the vascular cambium of trees in search of wood-boring insects. They regularly consume puriri moths (Aenetus virescens, Hepialidae), a giant species of ghost moth whose larvae tunnel into the heartwood of trees for protection. Puriri moths are host specific and frequently attack makomako (Aristotelia serrata, Elaeocarpaceae), a sub-canopy tree species. We conducted a field experiment in Zealandia, a nature reserve to which kaka were reintroduced over a decade ago, to test the hypothesis that kaka would increase tree fitness by removing larval parasites (i.e. herbivores). Contrary to our expectations, results revealed an additive, negative effect of both the predator (kaka) and parasite (puriri moths) on plant fitness. Therefore, the tri-trophic interactions restored by the reintroduction of kaka into Zealandia appear to be unique, as the actions of the predator decreased fruit and flower production, rather than increasing plant fitness, as typically reported for trophic cascades.",57,1,excluded,No green nest material

In this field study on another cavity-nester, tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, we tested whether yarrow reduced ectoparasite loads (the nest protection hypothesis), stimulated nestling immune systems (the drug hypothesis), or had other consequences for nestling growth or parental reproductive success (predicted by both preceding hypotheses). Tree swallows do not naturally add greenery to their nests, and thus offer several advantages in testing for effects of greenery independent of other potentially confounding explanations for the behaviour. We placed fresh yarrow in 23 swallow nests on the day the first egg was laid, replenishing every two days until clutch completion (=three times), and at 44 control nests, nesting material was simply touched. At 12 days of age, we measured nestling body size and mass, and took blood smears to do differential white blood cell counts. We subsequently determined the number and proportion of young fledging from nests and the number of fleas remaining after fledging. Higher humidity was associated with higher flea numbers whereas number of feathers in the nest was not. Our most significant finding was that an average of 773 fleas Ceratophyllus idius was found in control nests, versus 419 in yarrow nests. Possibly, parents compensate for blood that nestlings lose to ectoparasites by increasing food delivery, because we detected no differences between treatments in nestling mass, nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion of young fledging, or relative to flea numbers. Our results provide no support for the drug hypothesis and strong support for the nest protection hypothesis. Â© Journal of Avian Biology.",137,2,selected,

It is shown that the long-range electron-electron Coulomb interaction has no direct influence on these effects, aside from a possible renormalization of the corresponding constants. The electronic response functions and Sigma(s)(q,omega) are calculated for arbitrary vectors q and energy omega in the BCS approximation. The results obtained for q = 0 agree with previously obtained results. It is shown that for large wave numbers q, vertex corrections are negligible and Sigma(s)(q,omega) possesses a logarithmic singularity at omega = 2 Delta, where Delta is the superconducting gap. It is also shown that in systems with nesting, Sigma(s)(Q,omega) (where Q is the nesting vector) possesses a square-root singularity at omega = 2 Delta, i.e., exactly of the same type as at q = 0. The results are used to explain the recently published experimental data on phonon anomalies, observed in nickel borocarbides in the superconducting state, at large q.

Male and female mass were similar at the onset of prospecting. However, female mass had increased 25% by the start of egg laying, and females maintained the heavy mass through incubation. Females began losing mass at the time of hatching and reverted to weights that were similar to those of males by the end of hatching. Males neither gained nor lost mass during breeding. To test predictions from mass change hypotheses, 25 females were assigned manipulated broods of four or eight young. Females were weighed on the first day of hatching and 6, 10, and 27 days later, or until first fledging. Females with four and eight young lost the same amount of mass. Females lost less mass during brooding if their mates fed them more often. Females with four young tended to lose less mass during brooding if they spent less time away from the nest, whereas females with eight young tended to lose less mass if they spent more time away from the nest. Mass change after brooding was not related to provisioning rates of nestlings by females or males of either experimental group. Our results contradict the hypothesis that mass loss is due to stress, and correspond to some of the predictions of the adaptive, gonadal, and brooding starvation hypotheses.

In the present study, we show the relationship between cell-cycle phase and chemotherapy-induced tumor angiogenesis using in vivo FUCCI real-time imaging of the cell cycle and nestin-driven GFP to detect nascent blood vessels. We observed that chemotherapy-treated tumors, consisting of mostly of quiescent cancer cells after treatment, had much more and deeper tumor vessels than untreated tumors. These newly-vascularized cancer cells regrew rapidly after chemotherapy. In contrast, formerly quiescent cancer cells decoyed to S/G2 phase by a telomerase-dependent adenovirus did not induce tumor angiogenesis.

The American thrashers exhibit great variation in egg colouration and patterning, and also show variation in male brood patch development. A recent hypothesis suggests that conspicuous egg colouration has evolved as the product of sexual conflict, where females may create conspicuous eggs to obtain greater amounts of male care, either in the form of male incubation or incubation assistance to prevent their eggs from being vulnerable to visually orienting predators and brood parasites. The American thrashers, a genus comprising of 10 species, exhibits striking variation in egg colouration and patterning, and also show variation in male brood patch development. By using avian visual modelling, I show that blue-green chroma of American thrasher eggs is positively related to their degree of conspicuousness against a nest background, while brown chroma is negatively related. Interestingly, the degree of male brood patch vascularisation is directly related to eggshell conspicuousness in American thrashers. I suggest that in the American thrashers, male brood patch vascularisation has evolved in response to conspicuous eggshell colouration to mitigate visual risks. Here I show that the degree of male brood patch vascularisation is directly related to relative paternal incubation effort in more than 300 North American breeding birds. This suggests that American thrasher species that possess both conspicuous eggs and brood patches, have most likely evolved to keep these conspicuous nest contents concealed, thereby reducing risk of visual detection. I suggest that these patterns are not unique to thrashers, but may extend to several avian families.",265,1,excluded,Not experimental

Removal of dead cells and debris by phagocytes is necessary for tissue homeostasis. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that cultured SVZ cells phagocytose both 1 and 2 Î¼m latex beads and apoptotic cell-derived fragments. We determine by flow cytometry that phagocytic cells represent more than 10% of SVZ cultured cells. Phenotyping of SVZ cells using nestin, GFAP, Sox2, or LeX/SSEA and quantification of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, reveals that cells with neural stem-cell features phagocytose and represent more than 30% of SVZ phagocytic cells. In vivo, nestin-, Sox2-, and ALDH-expressing neural stem-like cells engulfed latex beads or apoptotic cell-derived fragments that were injected into mice lateral brain ventricles. We show also that SVZ cell phagocytic activity is an active process, which depends both on cytoskeleton dynamic and on recognition of phosphatidylserine eat-me signal, and is stimulated by the vitamin K-dependent factor protein S (ProS). ProS neutralizing antibodies inhibit SVZ cell phagocytic activity and exposure of SVZ cells to apoptotic cell-derived fragments induces a transient Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK) phosphorylation. Conversely, MerTK blocking antibodies impair both basal and ProS-stimulated SVZ cell phagocytic activity. By revealing that neural stem-like cells act within the SVZ neurogenic niche as phagocytes and that the ProS/MerTK path represents an endogenous regulatory mechanism for SVZ cell phagocytic activity, the present report opens-up new perspectives for both stem cell biology and brain physiopathology.

The beams, from three guns mounted together in a 2-inch diameter neck, are deflected by a single deflection yoke. The guns are pointed so that the electron beams converge to a spot on a thin, perforated metal sheet that acts as a mask and is located a short distance away from a viewing screen composed of many phosphor dots. Associated with each hole in the mask is a trio of phosphor dots capable of emitting the three primary colors, red, blue, and green. The dots are so placed that each electron beam as it scans can â€œseeâ€� only one dot of the trio. Each of the three beams is thus capable of exciting one color only, and when all three beams Ã¥re modulated with the appropriate primary color information, a picture in full color can be reproduced. An apparatus called the â€œlighthouseâ€� is used to record the locations of the phosphor dots on a photographic plate placed behind the mask and in the plane of the phosphor screen. A point source of light, at the position from which the deflection of one of the beams appears to take place, is used to simulate the electron beam in recording the phosphor dot positions. The pattern for one color of phosphor is the same as for the other two colors, and the geometry of the hole system in the mask is such that the three phosphor patterns nest together perfectly. The phosphor screens may be made by using various processes such as, electrostatic printing, offset printing, photoprinting processes, silk screening, and settling. The latter two methods have been used in the tubes described in the text. Experimental tubes have shown the principles of operation and construction to be sound.

It provides the developmental environment for the embryo and nestling thereby affecting their quality and survival. Nests are often constructed by the male and nest quality, elaboration, and ornamentation vary among males in a species. Therefore, male nest-building behaviour is likely under sexual selection and females may use male nest-building behaviour and nest features as cues in mate choice and their own reproductive investment. We tested this hypothesis in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Male starlings present green plants to females during their courtship display and furbish their nests with variable quantities of fresh green plants. The highest frequency of plant incorporation into the nest occurs during pair formation and oogenesis. We determined nest composition and measured yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs. Yolk testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with the amount of green plant material in nests. Because males use green nest material in courtship and green nest material positively affects nestlings' development, we suggest that female European starlings use male nest-building effort, ritualised courtship display of green plants, and nest characteristics in mate choice, and adjust yolk testosterone levels in the eggs to the quality of the nest to optimise offspring growth.",264,1,selected,

The first compared microclimate and parasite and pathogen load in plastic and wooden nest boxes. The second tested the nest protection hypothesis-that birds naturally incorporate aromatic herbs into nests to decrease nest parasites and pathogens-by comparing parasite and pathogen load in plastic nest boxes to which aromatic or non-aromatic plant material was added. No significant difference in nest-box temperature or relative humidity was found between plastic and wooden boxes. Wooden boxes, however, contained 30-fold higher numbers of fleas and a higher total bacterial load on chicks. Fledging success for blue tit broods was significantly higher in wooden boxes.

Potential hosts can reduce the cost of parasitism by rejecting foreign eggs from the nest. Observational, comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to identify parasitic eggs (eggâ€“nest contrast hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally test whether eggâ€“nest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two colours: orange and green. Contrary to the eggâ€“nest contrast hypothesis, host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn, experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg rejection rate. Our results demonstrate that eggâ€“nest contrast is a collateral, not a causal factor in egg rejection, and confirm the conclusions of previous studies that hosts can rely on the parasitic eggâ€™s appearance itself to recognize the foreign egg in the nest.

In addition to eggshell thinning caused by high levels of DDT and metabolites, the reproductive impairment is characterized by high embryonic and chick mortality, edema, growth retardation, and deformities, hence the name Great Lakes embryo mortality, edema, and deformities syndrome (GLEMEDS). The hypothesis has been advanced that GLEMEDS in colonial fish-eating birds resembles chick-edema disease of poultry and has been caused by exposure to chick-edema active compounds that have a common mode of action through the cytochrome P-448 system. Detailed evidence has been collected from the following three groups of studies on herring gulls in the lower Great Lakes during the early 1970s; Forster's terns in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1983; and double-crested cormorants and Caspian terns in various locations in the upper Great Lakes from 1986 onwards. It has proved difficult to establish not only the onset of the disease in the various species at various locations but also the period in which chick-edema active compounds were released. Anecdotal evidence suggested that serious egg mortality in Lake Ontario herring gulls first occurred in 1966, though the signs of chick-edema disease were not looked for until 1974. Only indirect evidence is available on the date of the release of one of the presumed causal agents, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, but highest levels may have occurred in the early to mid 1960s. More reliable data show that the onset of the improvement of reproduction of Lake Ontario herring gulls coincided with the declines in organochlorine compounds and particularly 2,3,7,8-TCDD and PCB. Similarly, information on the onset of the disease and exposures in the Forster's tern and double-crested cormorants in Green Bay is uncertain but bird banders did not observe deformities until the 1970s, which corresponds with the onset of high levels of PCB. If the disappearance of the Caspian tern from Saginaw Bay in the mid 1960s corresponds with the onset of GLEMEDS at that location, then there is a close temporal relationship to the onset of high PCB levels. Chick-edema disease is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific lesion, but rather there is a suite of lesions. GLEMEDS is characterized by an elevated incidence of embryonic and chick mortality, growth retardation, and developmental abnormalities, including bill deformities, club feet, missing eyes, and defective feathering, and there is also subcutaneous, percardial, and peritoneal edema, liver enlargement, liver necrosis, and porphyria. These signs conform to the known symptoms of chick-edema disease. A variety of chick-edema active compounds, including non-ortho-substituted PCBs and dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans substituted at the lateral positions, produce chick-edema disease. The active compounds have specific conformational requirements. In considering evidence on the strength of association, the embryos and chicks of herring gulls from Lake Ontario and Forster's terns from Green Bay had a significant increase in the incidence of the lesions compared to the reference colonies. Similarly, the incidence of bill abnormalities was significantly elevated in Great Lakes colonies of double-crested cormorants particularly for Green Bay, Wisconsin. There was a significant dose-response relationship between the incidence of embryonic mortality in cormorant eggs and the presence of chick-edema active compounds expressed in 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents. There is a high degree of consistency on replication. The disease has been found in a variety of species in a variety of locations, by different observers using different study designs. Outbreaks of the disease have occurred at different times and seem only to be related to exposures of developing embryos to high levels of chick-edema active compounds. The new facts, that embryos and chicks of colonial, fish-eating birds can exhibit signs resembling chick-edema disease when exposed to chick-edema active compounds, cohere with existing biological theory, experience, and experimentation. There are plausible routes of exposure and sources of these compounds to the Great Lakes, and statistically significant dose-response relationships have been demonstrated.",183,1,excluded,Not experimental

Clear assessment of the ecological and evolutionary impact of changing climatic temperature requires a natural system in which populations exhibit a direct unambiguous fitness response to thermal fluctuation. I monitored nests of a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination to investigate the causal relationship between local climatic variation in temperature and offspring sex ratio. Consistent with theoretical predictions, annual offspring sex ratio was highly correlated with mean July air temperature, validating concerns about the effect of climate change on population demography. This correlation implies that even modest increases in mean temperature (<2Â°C) may drastically skew the sex ratio. Statistical evaluation of the variance in climate change indicates that an increase in mean temperature of 4Â°C would effectively eliminate production of male offspring. Quantitative genetic analyses and behavioral data suggest that populations with temperature-dependent sex determination may be unable to evolve rapidly enough to counteract the negative fitness consequences of rapid global temperature change.

Aim: To assess if nestboxes of different construction and colour were occupied differently by breeding tits and affected breeding success. Methods: A total of 292 nestboxes of different construction and colour were placed in a range of habitats and their occupancy, and the clutch size, brood size and number of young fledged of the birds that used them were measured. Results: Overall 272 tit nests were included in the analysis. Although there were species-related differences in the occupancy of the different types of nestboxes, more tits nested in the boxes constructed from woodcrete (64% of nests) compared to the wooden boxes (36%). More tits nested in green (72%) rather than brown boxes (28%) and in boxes with entrance holes (68%) rather than wedges (32%). The clutch size, brood size and number of young fledged did not vary in relation to nestbox type.

It is likely that the smaller internal volume, internal darkness, insulating properties and perceived protection from predation were the reasons for these differences.

GNM_381,COTT19511,The palatability of the eggs of birds: illustrated by experiments on the food preferences of the Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus).,"COTT, H.B.",Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,121,1,Jan-41,1951,10.1111/j.1096-3642.1951.tb00726.x,"The paper describes the results of an investigation of the relative acceptability of the eggs of twentyâ€�five species of birds, belonging to ten orders, as illustrated by the feeding preferences of the Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus). In each of 332 experiments, one of four animals used as tasters was presented with a choice as between two eggâ€�samples. Possible disturbing factors such as differences in eggâ€�size or shellâ€�coloration, and those due to spatial arrangement of the samples, were eliminated by the use of raw egg, offered in equal quantities, and by the successive reversal in position of the eggâ€�species matched within a particular group of experiments, or as offered to a particular experimental animal. The reliability of the experimental method and the degree of consistency of hedgehog discrimination was checked by repetition experiments (between the same speciesâ€�pair), both for the same and for different individuals; and by linking and overlapping experiments (between pairs of eggâ€�species more or less widely separated in the edibility series). In general, the results show the hedgehog to be sensitive to differences in the relative palatability of the eggs offered, and to be consistent in its preferences and aversions, which show a broad agreement with those of man for the eggâ€�species considered. Separate experimental results are tabulated; the evidential value of the groups of experiments is discussed; and the edibility status of the several species considered. The experiments, which fall into groups carried out with sixty speciesâ€�pairs. afford a basis for the arrangement of the several species in a provisional hierarchy of preference: to each has been assigned a numerical edibility rating. The species fall broadly into three gradesâ€“here shown in descending order of acceptabilityâ€“as follows: (a) Palatable.â€“Kittiwake (Rissa t. tridactyla), Eider (Somateria m. mollissima), Razorbill (Alca torda britannica), Gannet (Sula bassana), Domestic Fowl (Gallus gallus). Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), Common Tern (Sterna h. hirundo), Coot (Fulica a. atra): (b) Intermediate.â€“Woodâ€�Pigeon (Columba p. palumbus). Little Owl (Athene noctua vidalii). Rook (Corvus f. frugilegus), Puffin (Fratercula arctica grabae), Magpie (Pica p. pica). Jackdaw (Corvus monedula spermologus). Hobby (Falco s. subbuteo). Kestre) (Falco t. tinnunculus). Little Grebe (Podiceps r. ruficollis), Buzzard (Buteo b. buteo), Arctie Tern (Sterna macrura), Ringed Plover (Charadrius h. hiaticula); (c) Distasteful.â€“Blackbird (Turdus m. merula), Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs gengleri), Sedgeâ€�Warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), Whitethroat (Sylvia c. communis), Linnet (Carduelis c. cannabina). Grounds are given for the belief that the preferences shown by hedgehogs are likely to correspond with those of other eggâ€�eating animals, and that, within the limits of the series examined, they afford a satisfactory basis for consideration of the data in general terms. The wide range in specitie edibility rating found to occur within certain orders. suggests that relative acceptability may be largely independent of systematic status: however, the low mean edibility rating for Passeriform species indicates a trend towards nauseousness within this order. No close or obvious connexion has been traced between relative acceptability of the egg and feeding habits of the parent: nor is the quality of the egg at all constantly related to that of the flesh in the species examined. On the other hand, the experimental results point towards correlations between relative acceptability and various other ecological factors likely to influence susceptibility to attack by predators. Firstly, there is a broad direct relationship between palatability of the egg and size of the parent. Secondly, the distribution, in terms of acceptability, of species having colonial and solitary nesting habits, respectively, shows a marked tendency for eggs of the former to be more, and those of the latter to be less palatable. Thirdly, consideration of eggâ€�palatability in relation to nestâ€�site, indicates that eggs laid in open nests in moderate growth or low herbage may be relatively distasteful as compared with those laid in various other situations. Fourthly, a general correlation is shown to exist between coloration of the shell and palatability of its contents. Broadly, cryptic eggs tend to belong to the higher edibility grades, and distinctively marked eggs to the lower edibility grades. The several species have been assessed in terms of relative vulnerability, account being taken of such factors as size, weapons of defence, powers of offence, availability of the clutch, general habits, sociability and coloration. A general inverse correlation is shown to exist between the degree of vulnerability and that of acceptabilityâ€“the most palatable eggs being those laid by nonâ€�vulnerable species, the most nauseous by those that are (otherwise) highly vulnerable. It is suggested that the facts point towards an adaptive interpretation of distastcfulness in eggs, coasidered as a deterrent to attack; and that the distinctive coloration of nauseous but otherwise vulnerable eggs may have a warning or recognitional value in relation to potential predators. 1951 The Zoological Society of London",385,1,excluded,No green nest material

Females then select between nests of the different males, normally choosing fresh green nests. Old nests fade to a dull brown. Experiments are reported that indicate nest colour is not a major factor in the selection of nests, although females had a tendency to prefer fresh nests painted green over fresh nests painted brown (z-test, P = 0Â·07). They did not differentiate between green-painted and unpainted nests, eliminating paint per se as a basis of choice. There was no significant difference in frequency of bouts of male display of green-painted and brown-painted fresh nests. Normally, males tear down a rejected nest as it turns brown and build a fresh nest in its place. Males tore down rejected brown-painted nests more than three times as often as they tore down green-painted nests, demonstrating an aversion to brown colour in nests.

Of 55 recaptures of 42 individuals, 22 (40%) had lost at leastone of its colour rings. Females showed a tendency to remove colour rings more frequently than males. For both sexes, there was a similar tendency to remove more dark than lightâ€�coloured rings. While it is not possible to identify a specific reason why the birds remove their colour rings, it is possible that discomfort on the nest may play a role in ring removal by females and, more speculatively, it is possible that males might remove colour rings to manipulate their sexual attractiveness to females. Wrapâ€�around rings might provide a solution to the problem of colourâ€�ringing species with powerful beaks. Â© 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",317,1,excluded,No green nest material

Potential for adverse population-level effects from site-specific contaminant exposures were evaluated at study areas (SAs) along the Tittabawassee and Saginaw rivers downstream of Midland. The site-specific multiple lines of evidence approach to hazard assessment included endpoints for dietary- and tissue-based exposures, and population productivity measurements for tree swallows ([TS]; Tachycineta bicolor) measured during the 2005, 2006, and 2007 breeding seasons. Exposure to dioxin-like compounds in TS eggs were some of the greatest recorded and were similar among all upstream and downstream study sites. Conversely, concentrations in nestlings from SAs were significantly greater compared to reference areas (RAs). The pattern of relative concentrations of PCDD/DFs in eggs and nestlings at RAs was dominated by dioxin congeners, whereas at SAs it was dominated by furan congeners. No statistically significant differences were noted in exposure to PCDD/DFs or in population-level responses when compared among locations, and total clutch failures were rare. Hatching success and fledging success were weakly negatively correlated with concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs) in individual eggs and nestlings, respectively. On-site concentrations of TEQs in floodplain soils were some of the greatest ever reported in the environment, and several lines of evidence indicate potential population-level effects on TS overall reproductive productivity.

Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.",15,1,selected,

In current study, fifty-one experimentally infected animal specimens and viral cultures that had been tested were analyzed by RT-LAMP for NA gene and HA gene, respectively. The amplification process of LAMP was monitored in real-time by the addition of SYBR Green dye. Meanwhile, the result showed high correlation between nested PCR and RT-LAMP. The specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis and sequencing of the amplified product. When the sensitivity of this assay was tested by serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA molecules from specimens, it was found that the RT-LAMP method achieved theoretically a sensitivity of 10 RNA molecules.
