This belief was recently revised by several studies showing that various bird species, including passerines, use olfaction in many respects of life. During courtship and nest building, male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) incorporate aromatic herbs that are rich in volatile compounds (e. g., milfoil, Achillea millefolium) into the nests and they use olfactory cues to identify these plants. Interestingly, European starlings show seasonal differences in their ability to respond to odour cues: odour sensitivity peaks during nest-building in the spring, but is almost non-existent during the non-breeding season. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used repeated in vivo Manganese-enhanced MRI to quantify for the first time possible seasonal changes in the anatomy and activity of the OB in starling brains. We demonstrated that the OB of the starling exhibits a functional seasonal plasticity of certain plant odour specificity and that the OB is only able to detect milfoil odour during the breeding season. Volumetric analysis showed that this seasonal change in activity is not linked to a change in OB volume. By subsequently experimentally elevating testosterone (T) in half of the males during the non-breeding season we showed that the OB volume was increased compared to controls. Conclusions/Significance: By investigating the neural substrate of seasonal olfactory sensitivity changes we show that the starlings' OB loses its ability during the non-breeding season to detect a natural odour of a plant preferred as green nest material by male starlings. We found that testosterone, applied during the non-breeding season, does not restore the discriminatory ability of the OB but has an influence on its size.",4,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

This behaviour is related to courtship but also benefits the nestlings. We tested in aviary experiments whether males select aromatic plants using olfaction and whether they depend on experience with nest odours they encountered as nestlings. We scented nests of wild starlings with milfoil, Achillea millefolium, a preferred nest plant of the starlings, and other control nests with vanilla. Fledglings from both nest types were hand-reared and tested the following year in dyadic choice experiments for their odour preference. Males from both milfoil- and vanilla-treated nests preferred milfoil scent when they had the choice between milfoil-scented versus vanilla-scented or versus unscented leaves. However, when they had to choose between vanilla scent and no scent, males from vanilla-treated nests chose vanilla scent but males from milfoil-treated nests did not discriminate. The disinterest of vanilla-inexperienced males in vanilla-scented leaves (when milfoil scent was lacking) and the preference for it in vanilla-experienced males implies learning during the nestling period. Because males discriminated between leaves of the same plant species looking the same but scented with different odours and because males without milfoil experience instantly preferred milfoil odour, we conclude that starlings use olfactory cues to select green nest material following an olfactory pattern designed prior to birth which may be supplemented by learning early in ontogeny.

Tests of egg discrimination ability by cavity-nesting tits under dim light conditions may reveal the selection pressure from brood parasitism that they encounter under natural interactions. We manipulated the intensity of luminance of nests of the Green-backed Tit (Parus monticolus), a potential cuckoo host that possesses a strong discrimination ability of non-mimetic foreign eggs. We performed experiments to test their egg discrimination ability under different light conditions. Our results showed that Green-backed Tits discriminate against non-mimetic foreign eggs under normal light conditions in nest boxes, and this ability persisted at nest luminance as low as 4.78 â€‹Â± â€‹1.31 lux that is several times lower than normal luminance (38.11 â€‹Â± â€‹24.02 lux). However, egg discrimination by Green-backed Tits disappeared when nest luminance was reduced to a minimum of 0.35 â€‹Â± â€‹0.15 lux. The latter value represents total darkness for humans. The present study shows that nest luminance plays a key role in egg discrimination by Green-backed Tits that build nests under dim light conditions.

Exposing an organism to ALAN during its early life could also have an impact on its development. Since photoperiod can trigger or schedule the migration timing of long-distance migratory birds, there is great potential for anthropogenic light to interact with photoperiod to affect timing. However, very little has been investigated regarding the impacts of ALAN on post-hatching development and migration timing. We investigated the impact of ALAN during nestling development in a long-distance migratory songbird to determine the potential impact on the timing of post-breeding movements in the wild. We experimentally manipulated the light by using programmable lighting, in the nest boxes of free-living nestlings of purple martin (Progne subis) in Manitoba, Canada. We exposed two groups of developing nestlings, from hatch to fledge date, to green or white LED lights (5 lux) during the night. We also included a control group that experienced natural, ambient light at night. We found that some adults abandoned their nests shortly after starting the experiment (4 of 15 nests in the white light treatment). For the nests that remained active, nestlings exposed to the white light treatment had higher weights (at day 20 or 22), later fledge dates (1.54 Â± 0.37, 95% CI 0.80â€“2.28), and later colony departure date (2.84 Â± 1.00, 95% CI 0.88â€“4.81), than young of the control group. Moreover, nestlings of both white and green light groups had longer nesting duration than nestlings of the control group. This study demonstrates the impact of ALAN on the development of post-breeding movement timing in nestlings of wild migratory birds. However, our results also indicate that green light may have less of an impact as compared to white light. Copyright Â© 2021 Bani Assadi and Fraser.",7,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

We used a large-scale study that experimentally manipulated herbicide application intensity within regenerating forests to test how herbicide-mediated changes in temperature influenced three components of reproductive output in the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon): nest survival, the number of offspring produced, and nestling body condition. We found no evidence for a consistent herbicide treatment effect on any reproductive measure, although our power to detect effects was modest. Relative to unsprayed controls, nest survival was lowest in the light herbicide treatment, and this measure increased on sites that were subjected to greater herbicide application (i.e., at moderate and intensive herbicide treatments), against our predictions. We also detected no evidence of a temperature effect singly or in combination with herbicide application on wren reproductive output. Although herbicide intensity was more influential on reproductive output than was temperature, we found that neither exerted strong effects in regenerating conifer forests.

Parents may, however, trade off catering for embryonic requirements against their own need to forage through intermittent incubation. This dynamically adjusted behaviour can be affected by properties of the nest. Here, we experimentally show a novel mechanism by which parents, through incorporation of aromatic herbs into nests, effectively modify their incubation behaviour to the benefit of their offspring. Our study species, the European starling, includes in its nest aromatic herbs which promote offspring fitness. We provided wild starlings with artificial nests including or excluding the typically selected fresh herbs and found strong support for our prediction of facilitated incubation. Herb effects were not explained by thermal changes of the nests per se, but by modified parental behaviours. Egg temperatures and nest attendance were higher in herb than herbless nests, egg temperatures dropped less frequently below critical thresholds and parents started their active day earlier. These effects were dynamic over time and particularly strong during early incubation. Incubation period was shorter in herb nests, and nestlings were heavier one week after hatching. Aromatic herbs hence influenced incubation in beneficial ways for offspring, possibly through pharmacological effects on incubating parents.",10,1,"selected",""

For adults, nest building entails costs in terms of time, energy, and exposure to predators and parasites. Amount and diversity of materials used for nest building depend on their availability and functionality in scenarios of sexual selection and parasitism. Green plants and feathers of different colors have been hypothesized to play key roles in offspring protection against pathogens, and we here experimentally assessed spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) preferences for pigmented versus unpigmented feathers and for different green plants (aromatic vs. non-aromatic plants) as nest materials. We predicted a preferential selection of unpigmented feathers and aromatic plants according to the antimicrobial properties of these materials described in the literature. We evaluated these predictions during nest building and during egg-laying stages. As expected, starlings preferentially selected unpigmented feathers both before and during egg laying, while aromatic plants were preferentially selected only during the egg-laying stage. These results suggest that starlings prefer nest materials that enhance antimicrobial protection of their offspring. We also discuss some other, non-exclusive functions that might explain the observed preference for nest materials, especially with regard to their potential role in sexual signaling.

The cort-adaptation hypothesis predicts that baseline concentrations of glucocorticoids are adjusted upward to match energetic needs and promote fitness when individuals are faced with physiological challenges, including those associated with reproduction. We tested the cort-adaptation hypothesis in the violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) by experimentally increasing flight costs during the offspring rearing period. Individual females were assigned to one of three treatments: light feather clipping (removal of four wing feathers), heavy feather clipping (removal of eight wing feathers) or a sham-clip control. We measured baseline corticosterone and body mass immediately prior to implementing treatments during the offspring rearing period and then 10Â days after initial manipulations took place. We also quantified risk-taking behaviour, offspring feeding rate and the number of offspring fledged. Finally, we examined how treatments influenced offspring phenotype via measurements of nestling body mass and baseline corticosterone, as both measures have been associated with post-fledging survival. We found that handicapped females significantly increased baseline corticosterone between the two sampling periods, with the magnitude of change in the light clipping and heavy clipping treatments 2Â·5Ã— and 6Â·1Ã— greater than controls, respectively. All individuals lost mass between the two sampling periods, but the degree of loss was greater for females in both clipping treatments relative to unmanipulated controls. In contrast, we found no evidence of treatment differences in female risk-taking, offspring provisioning or in the number of offspring fledged. Offspring raised by females in both handicapped treatments did have significantly elevated baseline corticosterone relative to those in control broods, but we detected no treatment differences in offspring body mass. Our study found that handicapped females increased circulating glucocorticoids and were able to maintain critical parental care behaviours and raise a similar number of offspring as unmanipulated controls. Thus, increases in baseline cort of handicapped females appeared to have allowed them to maintain fitness despite increased physiological challenges, providing support for the cort-adaptation hypothesis.

Several species of birds regularly introduce aromatic herbs into their nests putatively to reduce parasites. The behaviour is most often seen in cavity nesting birds and after nest building has finished. The plants are included in a non-structural manner and are often strongly aromatic. Various different hypotheses have been proposed regarding the function of this behaviour; from the plants altering some non-living factor in the nest (crypsis, water loss and insulation hypotheses) to them being involved in mate selection (mate hypothesis) or even having a beneficial effect, direct or indirect, on chicks (drug or nest protection hypothesis, NPH). Many studies have been carried out over the years observing and experimentally testing these hypotheses. This review focuses on studies involving the most popular of these hypotheses, the NPH: that plants decrease nest parasites or pathogens, thereby conveying positive effects to the chicks, allowing the behaviour to evolve. Studies providing observational evidence towards this hypothesis and those experimentally testing it are discussed. Â© Cambridge University Press 2015.",17,2,"excluded","Not empirical"

We supplemented roller (Coracias garrulus) nestlings with methionine in a between-nest design to investigate the way in which the sex and position in the hatching hierarchy affect the allocation of resources among growth, immunity, and plumage coloration. Methionine induces the production of lymphocytes at expense of growth; thus, we used it to manipulate growth and immunity, which are two traits likely to compromise plumage coloration. We predicted that late-hatched chicks within a brood (juniors) compared to early-hatched chicks (seniors) should allocate more to traits directly providing fitness than to ornamental traits because juniors are more affected than seniors by sibling competition. The methionine treatment effectively enhanced the production of lymphocytes in experimental broods. This appeared to be at the expense of plumage coloration in junior nestlings because, in supplemented nests, junior males showed a trend to display less greenish bellies than junior males from control nests. However, juniors from supplemented nests maintained wing growth as in control juniors. The plumage coloration of seniors was unaffected by the methionine supplementation, although they paid the costs of lymphocyte production at a level of growth that was reduced compared to senior nestlings in control nests. Hence, sex, and hatching order affected resource allocation among growth, immunity, and plumage coloration of roller nestlings.

Although mating with an attractive male may induce females to skew the sex ratio toward males, the balance between the benefits of producing attractive sons and the costs of competing with other females for mates could vary with female age, a possibility that had not been previously explored. In this paper we increment experimentally the attractiveness of males of the polygynous spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) by adding green plants to their nests, a trait involved in courtship, and look for female age-differential effects on offspring primary sex ratio. Young and middle aged females produced more sons in experimental than in control nests, as expected, but old females showed the opposite tendency. To explain this novel result, we speculate that older females are limited to produce the most costly sex because the physiological drawbacks imposed by ageing reduce their ability to compete with younger ones for the non-shareable resources offered by males. We discuss that this evolutionary scenario may be widespread in avian polygynous systems. Â© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",28,2,"selected",""

The highest abundance of soil fungi was recorded at the site adjacent to the bird nesting sites. Phoma herbarum was the most abundant taxon. Lecytophora lignicola and Ascotricha erinacea are new records for continental Antarctica. The fungal assemblage from the nutrient-deficient site was characterized by a dominance-diversity curve approaching the broken-stick model, the assemblage from the soil influenced by birds was characterized by a lognormal distribution. Plastic cloches were used in experiments designed to assess differences in fungal assemblages subjected to altered temperature and/or UV exposure. Dominance-diversity curves and diversity values of soil fungal mycobiota were compared in their natural condition as compared with manipulated conditions. Under the walled cloches, at both sites, artificial warming led to stress on Antarctic soil fungal assemblages. In contrast, UV protection led to a higher equilibrium in the assemblage structure. On the basis of the results obtained, it could be proposed that UV radiation is the most important limiting ecological factor for soil mycobiota in continental Antarctica.

Although experimental studies have shown that female birds may adjust offspring sex ratios in response to changes in their own condition and in the external appearance of their mate, and male attributes other than his external morphology are also thought to act as signals of male quality, it is not known whether females will respond to changes in such signals, in the absence of any change in the appearance of the male himself. Here, we experimentally manipulated a male courtship display, the green plants carried to the nest by male spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor), without changing any physical attributes of the male himself, and examined whether this influenced female decisions on offspring sex ratio. We found that in an environment in which female starlings were producing more daughters than sons, experimental enhancement of the green nesting material caused females to significantly increase the number of male eggs produced and thereby removed the female bias. This effect was consistent in 2 years and at two localities. This demonstrates that the green material, whose function has long puzzled biologists, conveys important information to the female and that she facultatively adjusts offspring production accordingly.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between depredation rate, nest camouflage and concealment in ground-nesting birds of farmlands, and their predators. We set up an experiment of 2576 artificial ground nests to assess the role of egg coloration (white, light green, and dark green), egg size (small, medium, and large), and vegetation structure (vegetation height and land use) in nest survival rates.

Atrazine, a residual herbicide with a wide range of reported environmental impacts, has been extensively applied in agricultural soils cultivated with gramineous crops. While atrazine persistence in soils has been widely studied by quantifying half-life from experimental dissipation curves, the spatial variability of half-life at the landscape scale has not been sufficiently explored. The objectives of this work were to estimate atrazine dissipation in a variety of soils and to map its spatial variability by modelling half-life as a function of environmental variables. Based on laboratory determination and environmental data, atrazine dissipation in soils was mapped across the territory of CÃ³rdoba province, central Argentina. First, we determined the dissipation parameters of atrazine under a variety of environmental conditions in 60 sites. Second, we fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model for the estimated atrazine half-lives, considering a soil site-specific property (soil organic carbon, SOC) and land use (gramineous crop, non-gramineous crop, pasture, and forest) as covariates. We used Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and stochastic partial differential equations to model the spatial dependence on random effects. The results suggest that atrazine half-life can be spatially predicted by SOC and land use. Atrazine dissipation was faster in sites with previous gramineous crops and high soil organic matter. The digital map allowed us to quantify the environmental variability of atrazine dissipation in CÃ³rdoba (3.2â€“99.5 days). The modelling strategy might be applied to other herbicide compounds by selecting proper environmental covariates. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",45,2,"excluded","Not birds"

The existence of niche differentiation is uniquely difficult to prove on account of the fact that historical interaction among species, which plays a key role in elucidating the current state of coexistence among species, is not well known. We created continuous niche gradients in nest-site resources between two sympatric secondary cavity-nesting birds, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus) and the russet sparrow (Passer cinnamomeus), and investigated whether nesting site is a factor contributing to limiting breeding overlap by regular inspection and 388,160Â min of film recording. Our results indicate that although we manipulated nest site availability to be uniformly high along the habitat gradient, the two bird species have little overlap in nest sites and rarely compete for them. Furthermore, the green-backed tit possessed a wide range of fundamental niche that covered that of the russet sparrow, while their reproductive time was largely segregated. The sparrow was more aggressive and outcompeted the tit in their overlapped range. These results suggest that even though nesting sites are crucial to the reproduction of cavity-nesting birds, some other factor plays a more important role in limiting niche overlap between sparrows and tits in space and time.

Herbicides are often used to control vegetation within early-successional forests, with unknown effects on avian vital rates. We used a large-scale experiment to test how nest and post-fledging survival were influenced by herbicide intensity within managed conifer plantations across 2 breeding seasons. We created a gradient of 4 stand-scale herbicide treatments (light, moderate, and intensive, and no-spray control) and evaluated the reproductive response of the White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), a declining songbird in managed forest landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. Against initial predictions, we found no evidence that either daily nest survival (n > 760 nests across all treatments) or post-fledging survival (n = 70 individuals reared in control and moderate treatments) were influenced by herbicide application intensity. Increased herbicide intensity resulted in an extensive reduction in vegetation cover at both stand and nest-patch scales; in contrast, vegetative cover at nest sites did not differ across herbicide treatments, nor was nest survival related to vegetation concealment measures. As the largest experimental investigation to assess forest herbicide effects on songbird demography, our study indicates that components of sparrow reproductive success were not influenced by experimental vegetation control measures, although additional work on other early-successional species will be useful to evaluate the generalities of our findings.

Widespread, long-term population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have elicited concern about potential negative effects of livestock management practices on sage-grouse populations. We evaluated how recently implemented rotational grazing systems affected sage-grouse nesting habitat quality as part of a large-scale, replicated, natural experiment in central Montana, USA. We used Bayesian methods to assess support for effects of rotational grazing management and rest from grazing on daily survival rates of nearly 500 sage-grouse nests monitored over 6 years, and mixed effects models to test for effects of rotational grazing and rest on vegetation structure. Though nests on rotationally grazed ranches displayed a trend toward greater daily survival rates, the evidence for an effect was weak. There was no evidence that rest from grazing (12 months) increased daily survival rates. Furthermore, rotational grazing systems and rest had negligible effects on herbaceous vegetation height and cover relative to other grazing strategies used in the study area. Results do not support the hypothesis that rotational grazing systems or rest from grazing increase nest success in the northern Great Plains. Estimated nest success, however, was comparable to range-wide averages, suggesting concealing cover for nests is unlikely to be limiting growth of this population regardless of grazing strategy. In light of these results and recent research questioning reported relationships between grass height and nest survival, maximization of hiding cover may be overemphasized in grazing management guidelines and policies. Rather, our findings suggest a variety of locally appropriate grazing strategies focused on fundamental range health principles may provide adequate habitat quality for nesting sage-grouse.

They can modify the bacterial and parasitic environment of the nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual signalling processes. In spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, green plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored these effects in two different populations, together with the potential effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres. Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of staphylococci on the skin of 8-day-old nestlings was negatively related to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these experimental effects. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

It was found that, in comparison to natural attenuation, bioremediation increased the removal efficiency by 76\% and 65\% for alkanes and aromatics, respectively. Increasing the nutrient concentration in the applied solution did not always enhance biodegradation as oxygen became limiting even when the beach was originally oxygen-rich. Therefore, replenishment of oxygen to oil-contaminated zone was also essential. Stimulation of oil biodegradation was more evident in the upper and midintertidal zone of the beach, and less in the lower intertidal zone. This was due to reduced nutrient and oxygen replenishment, as very little of the amendment solution reached that zone. It was found that under continual application, most of the oil biodegraded within 2 months, while it persisted for 6 months under natural conditions. While the difference in duration suggests minimal long-term effects, there are situations where the beach would need to be cleaned for major ecological functions, such as temporary nesting or feeding for migratory birds.

By contrast, the application rate of the amendment solution was dependent upon the subsurface extent of the oil-contaminated zone.

Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the following 3 years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity. Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total phenol content).

Three types of artificial nests (cup-shrub, cup-ground and bare-ground) were used along the altitudinal gradient. Overall, elevation had no effect on the daily survival rate (DSR) of the artificial nests. However, there was a significant elevation-nest type interaction. Daily survival rate for cup-shrub nests decreased significantly with elevation, but for cup-ground and bare-ground nests, elevation had no significant effect.

Daily survival rate for bare-ground nests significantly decreased with increasing canopy openness, and was positively influenced by coverage of herb layer and tree density.

However, these systems and landraces are being steadily replaced by fertilized monocultures of genetically improved varieties or maize hybrids. Little is known about how such changes may affect the belowground community of maize symbionts. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the composition of the indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities colonizing four Popoluca maize landraces and the hybrid Texcoco, and to determine how these communities are influenced by the level of phosphorus fertilization. Fragments of AMF ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were amplified using nested PCR, producing 327 Glomeromycota sequences. Phylogenetic analysis assigned the Glomeromycota sequences into 84 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). This number of OTUs more than doubles the figure previously reported for maize exposed to AMF native inoculum. Exclusive or very heterogeneous maize type-AMF associations were rare. Most AMF species colonized 2-4 maize types. This suggests that the high diversity of AMF in milpas is related to the presence of several native maize landraces and that replacement of these landraces with a single hybrid may diminish AMF community richness. All landraces associated with more OTUs under moderate P, compared to low P fertilization, suggesting that low inorganic phosphate (Pi) in milpas is limiting symbiotic interactions. However, only 0-20\% of OTUs were conserved between different P conditions for each landrace.

Uropygial secretions also reach eggshells during incubation and, therefore, may influence the coloration of birds' eggs, a trait that has attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists for more than one century. The color of hoopoe eggs typically changes along incubation, from bluish-gray to greenish-brown. Here, we test experimentally the hypothesis that dark uropygial secretion of females is responsible for such drastic color change. Moreover, since uropygial secretion of hoopoes has antimicrobial properties, we also explore the association between color and antimicrobial activity of the uropygial secretion of females. We found that eggs stayed bluish-gray in nests where female access to the uropygial secretion was experimentally blocked. Furthermore, experimental eggs that were maintained in incubators and manually smeared with uropygial secretion experienced similar color changes that naturally incubated eggs did, while control eggs that were not in contact with the secretions did not experience such color changes. All these results strongly support the hypothesis that female hoopoes use their uropygial gland secretion to color the eggs. Moreover, saturation of the uropygial secretion was associated with antimicrobial activity against Bacillus licheniformis. Given the known antimicrobial potential of uropygial secretions of birds, this finding opens the possibility that in scenarios of sexual selection, hoopoes in particular and birds in general signal antimicrobial properties of their uropygial secretion by mean of changes in egg coloration along incubation.

Species and guild responses, in terms of seasonal presence recorded by multiple point counts, were examined using generalized linear mixed models. Several guilds or migrant species responded positively to deer exclusion and none responded negatively. The shrub-layer foraging guild was recorded less frequently in older and browsed vegetation, in both winter and spring. Exclusion of deer also increased the occurrence of ground-foraging species in both seasons, although these species showed no strong response to vegetation age. The canopy-foraging guild was unaffected by deer exclusion or vegetation age in either season. There was seasonal variation in the responses of some individual resident species, including a significantly lower occurrence of Eurasian Wren Troglodytes troglodytes and European Robin Erithacus rubecula in browsed vegetation in winter, but no effect of browsing on those species in spring. Ordinations of bird assemblage compositions also revealed seasonal differences in response to gradients of vegetation structure generated by canopy-closure and exclusion of deer. Positive impacts of deer exclusion in winter are probably linked to reduced thermal cover and predator protection afforded by browsed vegetation, whereas species that responded positively in spring were also dependent on a dense understorey for nesting. The effects on birds of vegetation development and its modification by herbivores extend beyond breeding assemblages, with different mechanisms implicated and different species affected in winter.

Recent studies focus on the role of eggshell colour as a postmating sexually selected trait of females which manipulates male parental investment. A basic prediction of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers. This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality, females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component.

Nesting attempts can fail for various reasons, and determining risk of failure from specific causes associated with livestock grazing would enhance development of range management practices in areas managed for threatened grassland bird populations. Domestic livestock may influence nest failure by affecting vegetation structure, numerical or functional responses of predators, or directly by trampling nests. We hypothesized stocking rate may influence nest fate because it affects the amount and distribution of remaining vegetation, and the number of large herbivores to which nests are exposed. In 2007 and 2008, we evaluated nest fates for savannah sparrows and horned larks under 4 stocking rates experimentally applied in 40-ha paddocks in northeastern Oregon, USA. In addition to stocking rate, we evaluated variables such as vegetation structure and predator abundance and activity to help clarify mechanisms responsible for nest failure. We used a discrete competing risks framework to estimate daily probability of nest survival and failure from specific causes. These algorithms, implemented in a stand-alone graphical user interface-driven model, allow incorporation of covariates within an information theoretic approach to model inference. Although stocking rate influenced vegetation structure, the only nest failures related to stocking rate were from trampling. Trampling events were too infrequent to test for treatment effects (only 1 nest of each species), but occurred in the moderate and high stocking treatments. Additional variables were related to variation in nest failure from predation, but we found no support for the hypothesis that these causes of failure were affected by stocking rate. For savannah sparrows, daily probability of nest success (95% CI) = 0.97 (0.96-0.98); predation = 0.018 (0.008-0.028); and trampling = 0.001 (0.000-0.004). For horned larks, daily probability of nest success = 0.96 (0.95-0.98); predation = 0.029 (0.012-0.045); and trampling = 0.003 (0.000-0.007). Our results suggest grasslands managed for livestock may generally be compatible with grassland songbird conservation, at least for the species and stocking rates examined here. The most effective conservation strategies for improving nest success will involve decreasing risk of nest predation. However, we found no evidence that management of stocking rate is an effective method for doing so. Â© 2012 The Wildlife Society.

When such connections involve a host that provides a public good for multiple visitor species, selection for reciprocal cooperation is only likely if the host has the power to preferentially increase the fitness of those visitors that provide a better quality service. In contrast, when interactions form between multiple visitors and a host that lacks the power to partition the public good, we predict that interactions are likely to persist only as by-product mutualisms, in which symbiosis benefits both host and visitor, but in which neither partner makes costly investments. Focusing on the symbiosis between ants and litter trapping epiphytes in the canopy of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Borneo, we show that at least 71 ant species share the public good of housing within the root-mass of epiphytic bird's nest ferns (Asplenium spp.). Ferns supporting a higher biomass of ants experienced less herbivory, and experimental exclusions of ants from fronds confirmed that this is caused by the ants protecting the ferns from herbivores. These results establish that there are clear by-product benefits for both parties of housing for ants and protection for ferns. If these benefits were to drive selection for reciprocal cooperation, we would expect larger ferns to support ant colonies that were larger or colonies that produce more reproductive individuals. This was not the case. Larger ferns instead supported more ant colonies, indicating that the housing provided by the fern is a public good that is not restricted to better cooperating ant species. Mutualism via novel connections is thus unlikely to evolve between a host and multiple partners, even if there are clear by-product benefits to all parties, unless the host can direct benefits to cooperators.

Much attention to declining populations has focused on how changing climate drives phenological mismatches between animals and their food. Effects of climate on plant communities may provide an alternative, but particularly powerful, influence on animal populations because plants provide their habitats. Here, we show that abundances of deciduous trees and associated songbirds have declined with decreasing snowfall over 22 years of study in montane Arizona, USA. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that declining snowfall indirectly influences plants and associated birds by allowing greater over-winter herbivory by elk (Cervus canadensis). We excluded elk from one of two paired snowmelt drainages (10Ä�â€° ha per drainage), and replicated this paired experiment across three distant canyons. Over six years, we reversed multi-decade declines in plant and bird populations by experimentally inhibiting heavy winter herbivory associated with declining snowfall. Moreover, predation rates on songbird nests decreased in exclosures, despite higher abundances of nest predators, demonstrating the over-riding importance of habitat quality to avian recruitment. Thus, our results suggest that climate impacts on plant-animal interactions can have forceful ramifying effects on plants, birds, and ecological interactions. Â© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A fundamental untested assumption for the validation of this hypothesis is that males can accurately assess differences in the colour of eggs. A recent review suggests that this could be particularly problematic when egg clutches were located within a dimly lit nest cavity, due to limitations of the visual system in low light conditions. Here, we first used a photoreceptor noise-limited model of colour discrimination ability that accounts for visual performance under low light conditions to study whether a typical cavity-nesting passerine, the spotless starling Sturnus unicolor, can discriminate their eggs under the ambient illumination in their nest-holes. Secondly, we tested the validity of model predictions with behavioural data collected in two egg discrimination experiments performed in this species. Estimated egg detectability depended entirely on model assumptions about visual limitations linked to light intensity. Starlings would not be able to discriminate egg differences in their nests if the model was based on the assumption that light intensity limited detectability, whereas they could potentially perceive as different many possible pairwise clutch comparisons if the model assumption was that light intensity did not limit detectability. Results of behavioural experiments fitted the prediction of the visual model where light intensity did not limit detectability. Our results suggest that photoreceptor noise-limited colour models based on stimulation of single photoreceptors cannot, at present, be used to predict egg discrimination ability in spotless starlings under low light conditions. Future studies aiming to test egg discrimination constraints in the frame of the sexual selection hypothesis should therefore combine both modelling and behavioural experiments to determine which are the components of the models that produce the mismatch with the behavioural conditions.

Males were then retested to determine which colour of nest material they now preferred. Males had strong initial preferences for one or other of the two colours of nest material. Males that built a nest with their preferred colour of nest material continued to prefer that colour after nesting, regardless of their breeding success in that nest. However, of the males that built a nest with material of their nonpreferred colour, those that raised and fledged chicks from it subsequently preferred that colour of material for their second nest, while males that suffered a failed breeding attempt did not. Thus breeding experience can influence decisions relating to nest material choice in nest construction in the zebra finch. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The feather-carrying behaviour is a sexual behaviour that is performed in response to a male display: the carrying of green plants. In this paper we explore whether foreign feathers affect male investment on chick rearing or reinforce the pair mating bonds. The experimental addition of feathers to nests caused an increase in clutch size and a reduction of nestling mortality, although it did not affect feeding rates or the removal of faecal sacs by males or females. Nest feathers did not increase the frequency with which females laid a second clutch in the same nest and with the same male. Thus, our results do not support the sexual selection hypothesis for the evolution of the carrying feathers behaviour. An alternative hypothesis that deserves to be addressed in specifically designed studies is that foreign feathers may be taken to nests as a sort of chemical warfare against nest parasites. The sexual selection and the chemical defence hypotheses are, however, not mutually exclusive and future research should evaluate whether the pre-existence of a behavioural trait arising by natural selection may drive the evolution of a signalling trait.

We measured red (psittacofulvin), green (mixed) and blue (structural) colours of wild burrowing parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus of northeastern Patagonia, Argentina, and measured nestlings regularly to obtain data on breeding success and nestling growth. As adult feathers are moulted outside the breeding season, adult body condition could not be measured directly during feather growth, and climatic conditions were used as an indirect parameter. The colony of burrowing parrots is surrounded by Monte steppe habitat, the breeding success has been shown to depend strongly on the climatic patterns. The area experienced a drought with very poor breeding success as well as a year of above-average precipitation during the study period, serving as a natural experiment. We thus analysed the variability of colouration within the population among and within breeding seasons. We observed strong inter-annual differences in nestling and adult colouration. Nestlings grew blue feathers with lower achromatic brightness during better conditions, and when controlling for year effects, nestlings with higher mass and from more successful families also had blue feathers with lower achromatic brightness. Adult blue feathers showed the same trend, with lower achromatic brightness in the moult following breeding seasons of better conditions. In contrast, during better conditions, adults grew red feathers with higher achromatic brightness and the colour hue was also affected, and the hue of the red region of nestlings varied with the hatching order. The colour of all three regions of nestlings varied between nests, and the colour of the red region of adult males positively correlated with breeding success (clutch size, brood size). In summary, the present data suggest that environmental conditions contribute to variability in both structural and the psittacofulvin-based colours of wild burrowing parrots.

Blue-green color intensity would reflect the physiological condition of females, and hence it might also affect the allocation of male parental care. In this study, we use three different experimental approaches to explore the importance of sexual selection on blue-green egg coloration of spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) eggs. First, experimental deterioration of female body condition (by means of wing feather removal) negatively affected the intensity of blue-green egg coloration. Second, blue-green color intensity of artificial model eggs had a significant positive influence on paternal feeding effort. Finally, we found a negative relationship between the effect of experimental food supply on nestling immunocompetence and the intensity of blue-green coloration of eggs, suggesting that egg color predicts nutritional conditions that nestlings will experience during development. All these results taken together strongly support a role of sexual selection in the blue-green coloration of spotless starling eggs. Â© 2007 by The University of Chicago.

Major companies are planning reclamation strategies for mine tailings, in which wetlands will be used for the bioremediation of water and sediments contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthenic acids during the extraction process. A series of experimental wetlands were built on companies' leases to assess the feasibility of this approach, and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were designated as upper trophic biological sentinels. From May to July 2004, prevalence and intensity of infestation with bird blow flies Protocalliphora spp. (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were measured in nests on oil sands reclaimed wetlands and compared with those on a reference site. Nestling growth and survival also were monitored. Prevalence of infestation was surprisingly high for a small cavity nester; 100% of the 38 nests examined were infested. Nests on wetlands containing oil sands waste materials harbored on average from 60% to 72% more blow fly larvae than those on the reference site. Nestlings on reclaimed sites suffered mean parasitic burdens about twice that of those on the reference site; and for comparable parasitic load, they exhibited greater pathologic effects (e.g., decreased body mass) than control nestlings. The heavy blow fly infestation on oil sands-impacted wetlands suggests that oil sands mining disturbs several components of the local, ecosystem, including habitat characteristics, blow fly predators, and host resistance to parasites.

In a field study, we investigated whether these herbs affect the mite and bacteria load of the nests and the condition of the nestlings either directly or via parasite control. We examined the amount of herbs and the number of plant species males carried into their nests, the variation of volatile compounds in the headspace air of the nest boxes and mite/bacteria load of the nests throughout the season. The amount of herb material and the number of plant species, the number of substances emanated by these plants and the infestation of the nests with bacteria and mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) increased with season. In a field experiment, we exchanged natural starling nests with experimental nests with or without herbs. We found that the herbs had no effect on the mites but fewer bacteria were sampled in nests with herbs than in nests without herbs. The body mass of the fledging was not related to the season or the mite/bacteria load of the nests. However, nestlings from nests with herbs fledged with higher body mass than nestlings from nests without herbs. Both bacteria and mite load were related to nestling mortality. In nests containing no herbs, the numbers of fledglings declined significantly with the increasing mite load while the mites had no effect on the number of fledglings in nests with herbs. Thus, the nest herbs counteracted the effect of the mites. In conclusion, it seems that volatile herbs can reduce bacterial but not mite infestation of the starling nests. The positive influence of herbs on nestling growth indicates that herbs either directly (perhaps as immunostimulants) improve the condition of the nestlings and help them cope with the harmful effects of mites, or they provide a nest environment beneficial for the nestlings' development by the reduction of germs.

Guapira trees produce small fruits with a high protein content (28.4%) and low lipid content (0.3%), and the plant is primarily dispersed by birds. Mature fruits of G. opposita can fall spontaneously with the pulp intact, or be dropped by birds with bits of pulp attached. In either case, ground-dwelling ants rapidly remove the fruits to their nest (93% after 12 h). The ponerine ants Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata are the main seed vectors among the ants, and together account for 56% (20 of 36) of the ant-fruit interactions recorded on the forest floor. Individual workers of O. chelifer and P. striata transport single fruits to their nests. Bits of pulp are fed to larvae and worker nestmates, and intact seeds are discarded outside the nest. Germination success in Guapira is higher for cleaned seeds (pulp removed) than for seeds coated by pulp. Guapira seedlings and juveniles are more frequent close to Odontomachus nests than at sites without such nests. Soil samples from Odontomachus nests had greater penetrability, and higher concentrations of P, K, and Ca than random soil samples. Field experiments suggest that the association between G. opposita seedlings and O. chelifer nests can potentially render the plant some protection against herbivores. Results indicate that fruit displacement by ponerine ants play an important role in the biology of G. opposita seeds and seedlings in the sandy forest, and illustrate the complex nature of the dispersal ecology of tropical tree species.

Three new IVC filters have recently been approved for use in the United States. An in vitro study was performed to compare the risk of engaging and entrapping guide wires in eight of the IVC filters currently available in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium Greenfield, over-the-wire stainless-steel Greenfield, Simon nitinol, Bird's Nest, Vena Tech LGM, Vena Tech LP, TrapEase, and GÃ¼nther Tulip IVC filters were deployed separately in an in vitro IVC flow model. Four different wires (15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped, and straight) were passed 100 times each through the filters (50 from a jugular approach and 50 from a femoral approach). The frequency and specific patterns of engagement of the wires by the filters were recorded. Engagement was defined as a filter/wire interaction that caused either the filter or the wire to be deformed. The second part of the experiment measured the force (in pounds) that was required to release wires that became engaged in the filters with use of an electromechanical test stand with a specially designed low-capacity load cell of 20 pounds. Entrapment was defined as inability to separate an engaged wire from the filter without damage to either the wire or filter. RESULTS: Guide wire engagement occurred in all filters tested with the 15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped wires. The straight wire did not engage any of the filters. The wires engaged the TrapEase filter with the greatest frequency overall (72.8%; 291 of 400). The 15-mm J wire engaged the filters more often than the other wires (98.5%; 788 of 800), but never became entrapped in a filter. The Vena Tech LP and GÃ¼nther Tulip filters did not entrap any of the wires. The TrapEase filter, the stainless-steel Greenfield filter, and the Vena Tech LGM filter entrapped the 3-mm and 1.5-mm J wires. The force required to disengage the wires from these filters exceeded 4 pounds and resulted in structural damage to the wire and/or filter. CONCLUSIONS: Among the IVC filters recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the TrapEase filter entrapped 3-mm and 1.5-mm J-tipped guide wires, whereas the Vena Tech LP and GÃ¼nther Tulip filters did not.

Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from 210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the 1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends on Brooding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30 year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina; Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seirus aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food availability and events in the migratory and winter periods. Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term population trends. The results also imply that any conclusions about the effects of other factors affecting forest bird abundances, such as increased nest predation or brood parasitism associated with habitat fragmentation, must also account for successional changes that may be affecting habitat suitability.",163,2,"excluded","Not experimental"

Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.

After genotoxic stress glioma cells initiate cytoprotective autophagy, which contributes to treatment resistance, limiting the efficacy of these therapies and providing an avenue for glioma recurrence. Antagonism of autophagy steps has recently gained attention as it may enhance the efficacy of classical chemotherapies and newer immune-stimulating therapies. The modulation of autophagy in the clinic is limited by the low potency of common autophagy inhibitors and the inability of newer ones to cross the blood-brain barrier. Herein, we leverage lucanthone, an anti-schistosomal agent which crosses the blood-brain barrier and was recently reported to act as an autophagy inhibitor in breast cancer cells. Our studies show that lucanthone was toxic to glioma cells by inhibiting autophagy. It enhanced anti-glioma temozolomide (TMZ) efficacy at sub-cytotoxic concentrations, and suppressed the growth of stem-like glioma cells and temozolomide-resistant glioma stem cells. In vivo lucanthone slowed tumor growth: reduced numbers of Olig2+ glioma cells, normalized tumor vasculature, and reduced tumor hypoxia. We propose that lucanthone may serve to perturb a mechanism of temozolomide resistance and allow for successful treatment of TMZ-resistant glioblastoma.

Here I analyze the egg appearance of an East African weaverbird species that has variable eggs and is a host of brood parasitism by an egg-mimicking cuckoo, in order to (1) compare population variation to variation within a clutch as a measure of the distinctiveness of eggs; (2) assess modularity versus correlation among egg appearance traits as an indication of the complexity of egg signatures; and (3) address whether the eggs are discretely polymorphic or continuously variable in appearance. I also compare three methods of assessing egg coloration: reduction of spectral data to orthogonal components, targeted spectral shape variables, and avian visual modeling. Then I report the results of egg replacement experiments that assess the relationship between egg rejection behavior and the difference in appearance between own and foreign eggs. RÃ¼ppellâ€™s weaver (Ploceus galbula) eggs are variable in appearance between individuals and consistent within a clutch, but vary widely in the distinctiveness of particular traits. Most aspects of color and spotting are decoupled from each other, including coloration likely to derive from different pigments. Egg ground color is bimodal, with a broad continuous class of off-white/UV eggs and another broad class of blue-green eggs. Variation in all other traits is unimodal and usually normal in distribution. Females reject foreign eggs on the basis of the difference in brightness of the ground color and spotting of foreign eggs relative to their own, and the difference in degree to which spots are aggregated at the broad end of the egg. This aggregation is among the most distinctive features of their eggs, but the brightness of the ground color and spotting brightness are not; the birdsâ€™ use of brightness rather than the more distinctive chromatic variation to recognize eggs might reflect the salience of achromatic contrast in a dim enclosed nest.

Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were assigned to groups (n = 10/group); 1) saline control, 2) saline+Saireito, 3) saline+EO, 4) saline+EO/Saireito, 5) AOM/DSS control, 6) AOM/DSS+Saireito, 7) AOM/DSS+EO and 8) AOM/DSS+EO/Saireito. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline or AOM (7.4 mg/kg) on day 0 and underwent three DSS/water cycles (2%w/v DSS for 7 days, 14 days water). Mice were orally-gavaged with either water (80 ÂµL), Saireito (80 ÂµL), EO (80 ÂµL) or EO/Saireito (160 ÂµL; 80 ÂµL EO + 80 ÂµL Saireito) thrice weekly. Daily bodyweight and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded and colonoscopies performed on days 20, 41 and 62. Mice were euthanized on day 63. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: AOM/DSS induced significant bodyweight loss throughout the trial (max âˆ’36%), which was attenuated by Saireito (max +7%), EO (max +5%) and EO/Saireito (max +14%; p < 0.05). AOM/DSS increased DAI compared to saline controls (p < 0.05), which was reduced by Saireito, EO and EO/Saireito (p < 0.05). All treatments reduced colonoscopically-assessed colitis severity (days 20 and 41; p < 0.05). EO/Saireito further decreased colitis severity compared to Saireito and EO alone (day 20; p < 0.05). Finally, EO and EO/Saireito resulted in fewer colonic tumours compared to AOM/DSS controls (p < 0.05).

Living fences in abandoned croplands, however, add a structural component to the landscape which can help to mitigate the effects of disturbance. We used artificial nests to assess whether a living fence at the edge of a fragment of tropical dry forest, immersed in an agricultural landscape, can assuage the edge effect by decreasing predation rates. We identified the predators that attacked nests at several distances from the living fence and related the frequency of predator attacks with plant height, leaf height diversity, and tree and herb coverage. Vegetation structure of the living fence was vertically more complex than that found inside the fragment. 52% of nests were predated and we did not find a significant relationship between predation rates and the proximity of nests to the living fence, suggesting a null edge effect on predation. Birds were the most frequent predators, followed by rodents and carnivorous mammals, with the composition of predators varying among transects. The composition of predators and vegetation structure of the living fence were the factors that explained the null edge effect on nests predation. Our results indicate that the presence of a living fence at the edge of a fragment in agroforestry systems could mitigate the edge effects on nest predation.

In rats interneuronal circuits at two levels of the spinal cord (i.e., L6-S1 and L3-L4) play an important role in this coordination. In the present experiments retrograde trans-synaptic transport of pseudorabies virus (PRV) encoding fluorescent markers (GFP and RFP) was used to trace these circuits. To examine the relative localization of EUS-related and BL-related interneuronal populations we injected PRV-GFP into the EUS and PRV-RFP into the BL wall. The PRV infected populations of spinal interneurons were localized primarily in the dorsal commissure (DCM) of L6/S1 and in a hypothesized lumbar spinal coordinating center (LSCC) in L3/L4 above and lateral to central canal (CC). At both sites colocalization of markers occurred in a substantial number of labeled interneurons indicating concomitant involvement of these double-labelled neurons in the EUS- and BL-circuits and suggesting their role in EUS-BL coordination. Intense GFP or RFP fluorescent was detected in a subpopulation of cells at both sites suggesting that they were infected earlier and therefore likely to represent first order, primary interneurons that directly synapse with output neurons. Larger numbers of weakly fluorescent neurons that likely represent second order interneurons were also identified. Within the population of EUS-related first order interneurons only 3â€“8 % exhibited positive immunoreaction for an early transcription factor Pax2 specific to GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory neurons suggesting that the majority of interneurons in DCM and LSCC projecting directly to the EUS motoneurons are excitatory.

We used a large-scale study that experimentally manipulated herbicide application intensity within regenerating forests to test how herbicide-mediated changes in temperature influenced three components of reproductive output in the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon): nest survival, the number of offspring produced, and nestling body condition. We found no evidence for a consistent herbicide treatment effect on any reproductive measure, although our power to detect effects was modest. Relative to unsprayed controls, nest survival was lowest in the light herbicide treatment, and this measure increased on sites that were subjected to greater herbicide application (i.e., at moderate and intensive herbicide treatments), against our predictions. We also detected no evidence of a temperature effect singly or in combination with herbicide application on wren reproductive output. Although herbicide intensity was more influential on reproductive output than was temperature, we found that neither exerted strong effects in regenerating conifer forests. Given the dearth of studies that combine evaluations of temperature and land management impacts on songbird reproductive output, we suggest researchers continue to expand our understanding of the relative influence of both drivers simultaneously to better formulate conservation strategies in light of expected changes in climate and a heightened global demand for wood products.

To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predatorâ€“prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (nÂ =Â 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predatorâ€“prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development.

NSCs and miR-26a-NSCs were stereoscopically injected into the cerebral cortex of the modeled rats, respectively. The survival and migration of NSCs infected with recombinant lentivirus expressing green fluorescence in vivo was observed under a light microscope. The neurobehavioral functions, morphology, and ultrastructure of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, apoptosis of brain cells, expression of apoptosis-related protein caspase-3 and Bax, together with the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were determined. Expression of miR-26a in NSCs infected with plVTHM-miR-26a increased significantly. After NSCs transplantation, the neurobehavioral status of CP rats was improved, the degree of brain pathological injury was alleviated, the apoptotic index of cells in cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the expression of the apoptotic protein (caspase-3 and Bax) were decreased, the expression of GFAP were significantly decreased. After miR-26a-NSCs transplantation, these aforementioned results further improved or decreased.

Although numerous exclosure experiments have demonstrated negative impacts of deer on songbirds at small spatial scales, the effects of deer on avian communities at large spatial and temporal scales remains poorly understood. We integrated data from the Breeding Bird Survey with historic information on deer abundance in a multi-species hierarchical model to assess spatio-temporal relationships between deer and bird abundances across the state of Pennsylvania between 1981 and 2015. Our results provide evidence of strong links between deer and both avian functional groups and individual species, depending upon the extent each relied upon particular forest strata. Specifically, species that forage or nest near the ground were more negatively affected by deer than canopy-associated species. Likewise, mature-forest species were more sensitive to deer than successional-forest species or habitat generalists. With only a few exceptions, species-level responses to deer were consistent with group-level effects. Given the diverse suite of spatio-temporal stressors impacting migratory songbirds throughout their annual cycle, it was not surprising that long-term population trends of focal species were not significantly associated with deer abundance. Our findings, however, provide evidence that deer play an important role in songbird community structure, as mediated by the reliance of individual species upon particular forest strata and, as such, should be considered within the context of forest bird conservation.

Apart from this, the important role in this circle was played by the author of the poster of the first Dada-soirÃ©e in Zurich, Marceli Slodki, who became a director of the Wilde BÃ¼hne, representing the theater of the absolute linked to Die Aktion, as well as the art critic of the Ã‰cole de Paris, Adolf Basler. Artists from Poland who could be described as having multiple identities, in the sense of their national self-identification, also contributed to the success of artistic imperium of Der Sturm during all phases of its existence - since the first exhibition in his gallery (Franz/Franciszek Flaum, 1912) and first Yearbook of his magazine (Tadeusz/ThaddÃ¤us Rittner) through the Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon 1912 (StanisÅ‚aw StÃ¼ckgold and Ludwik Markus/Louis Marcoussis). Before the First World War also Basler contributed to Der Sturm, publishing his reviews on art. After the Great War, several artists and writers from Poland sympathized with Waldenâ€™s artistic center, among them Aleksander Wat, Anatol Stern, Szymon Syrkus, Tadeusz Peiper, and Kazimir Malevich (the last, however, was presented there as the Soviet one), as well as Jakub Steinhardt and Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum. The first who exhibited in Der Sturm, 1919/1920, was however StanisÅ‚aw Kubicki, initiator of the abstract art in Poland, followed by Teresa Å»arnower, Mieczyslaw Szczuka, Henryk/Henoch Berlewi, and Feliks Krassowski, who co-introduced to Walden Productivism, new media and typography, photomontage and experimental theater. The third artistic circle in Berlin that was crucial to artists from Poland was the Novembergruppe, which co-organized the I International Exhibition and the Congress of the International Union Progressive Artists in DÃ¼sseldorf, enthusiastically revised by Berlewi. These events are regarded as the most important contribution of the artists from Poland abroad to the founding of the Constructivist International. To the separatists of the Congress Kubicki, who together with the former members of the anarchist group Die Kommune, organized the International Exhibition of the Revolutionary Artists in Berlin, initiating the founding of the Group of the Progressive Artist in Cologne, the leading New Reality formation in Germany.

We investigated the relationships between exposure to NOE and older adults' self-rated health in Shanghai, China and examined whether these relationships varied by sex, age, education and hukou status. Method: This cross-sectional study used micro-data sample of the 2010 Shanghai population census, including 7962 older adults nested within 3345 neighbourhoods. Self-rated health was the outcome variable. Four NOE exposure indicators were calculated for each neighbourhood: the amount of surrounding greenness/blueness and proximity to large green/blue spaces. Multilevel logistic regression was employed to explore the association between natural outdoor environment exposure and self-rated health, adjusting for individual-level and neighbourhood-level covariates. Stratified analyses were used to examine variations by sex, age, education and hukou status. Results: Older adults living in neighbourhoods with higher surrounding greenness and higher proximity to both green spaces and blue spaces were more likely to report good health. Residential surrounding blueness was not significantly related to self-rated health.

Considering recent advancements in the field of direct transdifferentiation, conversion of astrocytes as a prominent component of glial scars to the progenitor cells that contribute to the repair mechanisms seems interesting. Recently, we have reported miR-302/367-mediated in vivo conversion of astrocytes into neuroblasts and neurons. In the current study, we used miR-302/367 and valproate (VPA) to show the possibility of conversion of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and myelinating cells in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced model of demyelination. Evaluation of behavioural impairment following CPZ and consequent to the treatments showed functional recovery from impairments. Enhanced remyelination was detected by luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining against two mature myelin markers, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein. Tracing of transduced cells with green fluorescent protein showed their contribution toward generation of new myelinating cells. These findings have suggested that in vivo specific targeting of astrocytes for forced expression of the miR-302/367 cluster and VPA administration may increase the brain's potential for repairing myelin insults by the generation of oligodendroglia from astrocytes.

For example, Mus musculus do not readily imitate sounds, a trait known as vocal learning and a feature of speech. In contrast, thousands of bird species exhibit this ability. The circuits and underlying molecular mechanisms appear similar between disparate avian orders and are shared with humans. An advantage of studying vocal learning birds is that the neurons dedicated to this trait are nested within the surrounding brain regions, providing anatomical targets for relating brain and behavior. In songbirds, these nuclei are known as the song control system. Molecular function can be interrogated in non-traditional model organisms by exploiting the ability of viruses to insert genetic material into neurons to drive expression of experimenter-defined genes.

Competition for breeding resources or mates is predicted to affect the expression of signals in both males and females; however, the literature has been typically focused on male behaviors. The spotless starling is an interesting example where both sexes decorate the nest to signal their condition and social status: males add green plants at the beginning of the breeding period, and females place foreign feathers during the incubation period. In this study, we investigate nest decoration by males and females in relation to the intensity of conspecific competition during the breeding period. We distributed nest boxes at either a high (HD) or a low density (LD) and recorded the amount of green plant material added before laying, the number of feathers at hatching, and the breeding productivity under these different density treatments. The amount of green plant material and the number of feathers at hatching were higher in HD than in LD nests. Furthermore, nest boxes at higher density had lower breeding productivity. Our results suggest that manipulating the density of nest boxes increased competition for breeding resources. The aggregation of males competing for territories and mates may stimulate them to add greater amounts of plants, and competition over those males or other resources for reproduction may induce females to add feathers. This study shows that social environment has the potential to influence the expression of signaling behaviors in both males and females. Â© The Author 2017.",222,1,"excluded","No green nest material

Carrier pigeons are used for recreational activities such as bird contests and exhibitions. Due to the close contact with humans, these birds may potentially represent a public health risk, since they can host and disseminate zoonotic parasites, such as those belonging to the genus Cryptosporidium (phylum Apicomplexa). The purpose of this work was the detection by microscopic and molecular techniques of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in fecal samples of carrier pigeons, and subsequently to sequence the 18S ribosomal RNA marker of positive samples to identify the species. A total of 100 fecal samples were collected individually in two pigeon breeding facilities from Formiga and AraÃ§atuba, cities located in Minas Gerais state and SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil, respectively. The age of the birds ranged from one to 12 years; 56 were females and 44 males. Fecal smears were stained with negative malachite green, whereas the molecular characterization was based on the sequence of a âˆ¼800Â bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene. Microscopic examination of fecal smears revealed 4% (4/100) oocyst positivity. On the other hand, 7% (7/100) of positivity were found using nested PCR. Three samples were 99% to 100% similar to Cryptosporidium parvum 18S rDNA type A (Genbank AH006572) and the other three samples had 99% to 100% similarity to C. parvum 18S rDNA type B (Genbank AF308600).

Ants are prominent bioindicators used in assessing ecological responses to disturbance. However, behavioral data have been poorly incorporated as an index. The foraging performance of red harvester ants was quantified in order to evaluate the success of a restoration ecology experiment in the tropical dry forest of Sierra de Huautla, Morelos, in central Mexico. Foraging performance by granivorous, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, ants was diminished after 6 and 8 years of cattle grazing and wood harvest were excluded as part of a restoration experiment in a highly degraded biome. Despite investing more time in foraging, ant colonies in exclusion plots showed lower foraging success and acquired less seed biomass than colonies in control plots. In line with the predictions of optimal foraging theory, in restored plots where ant foraging performance was poor, ants harvested a higher diversity of seeds. Reduced foraging success and increased harvest of non-preferred foods in exclusion plots were likely due to the growth of herbaceous vegetation, which impedes travel by foragers. Moreover, by 8 years of exclusion, 37% of nests in exclusion plots had disappeared compared to 0% of nests in control plots. Ants' foraging success and behavior were sensitive to changes in habitat quality due to the plant successional process triggered by a restoration intervention.

However, in most studies the exact amount of light at night individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects, e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of light at night.

We isolated neuronal progenitor cells from the subventricular zone of 5-week-old mice to investigate the role of gap junctions, calcium homeostasis, and cellular networks in cell differentiation and survival. Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR showed that the cells expressed the gap junction components connexin 26, 36, 43, and 45, and that expression of connexin 43 increased in early (8 days) differentiated cells. Transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry also indicated that gap junctions were present. Scrape-loading experiments showed dye transfer between cells that could be prevented by gapjunction blockers; thus, functional intercellular gap junctions had been established. However, dye transfer was four times stronger in differentiated cultures, correlating with the increased connexin 43 expression. During timelapse calcium imaging, both differentiated and undifferentiated cultures showed spontaneous calcium activity that was reduced by gap junction blockers. Crosscorrelation analysis of the calcium recordings showed that the cells were interconnected through gap junctions and that the early-differentiated cells were organized in smallworld networks. Gap junction blockers did not affect proliferation and differentiation, but resulted in twice as many apoptotic cells. mRNAi knockdown of connexin 43 also doubled the number of apoptotic cells. We conclude that adult neural progenitor cells form networks in vitro that are strengthened during early differentiation by increased expression of connexin 43. The networks are functional and improve cell survival. Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",239,1,"excluded","Out of field"

Previous studies have focused on flowering phenology with few efforts given to the phenological successes and vegetative processes. Additionally, grazing is often characterized as a driver for community evolutionary processes, while precipitation is known as the most important abiotic cue in arid regions. Given this knowledge, we installed a nested experiment in a desert steppe to explore the coupled effects of grazing and watering on plant speciesâ€™ reproductive successes and phenological timing in 2012â€“2013. We found that grazing increased the proportion of non-flowering individuals, with a greater proportion in 2013 than that in 2012. It decreased species richness and changed the habitat preferences in both years, and watering also reduced the richness in both years. Grazing also delayed the phenological timing for some dominant species and significantly delayed the green-up timing (5.67Â days) and shortened the growing season length (GSL) in both 2012 (7.74Â days) and 2013 (4.71Â days). The application of watering, however, delayed some dominant speciesâ€™ timingâ€”including the browning timing of five dominate species ranging from 9.57Â days in 2013 to 1.93Â days in 2012â€”but it did not delay the speciesâ€™ green-up timing. This resulted in a significantly prolonged growing season in 2013 (8.58Â days).

Based on the evidence for the neurogenic role of serotonin (5-HT) in the postnatal gut and the observation of enteric neuronal hyperplasia in inflammatory bowel disease, we hypothesized that colitis induces a neurogenic response through 5-HT 4 receptor signaling. Methods: We examined the effects of 5-HT 4 agonism on colonic neurogenesis and gliogenesis in vitro and in vivo in adult mice using dextran sodium sulfate to experimentally induce colitis. Results: In vitro, 5-HT 4 agonism led to increased neuronal proliferation and density. Induction of experimental colitis in vivo similarly resulted in increased numbers of myenteric neurons, and this was inhibited by 5-HT 4 antagonism. Interestingly, both in vitro and in vivo, 5-HT 4 signaling increased glial cell proliferation but did not increase glial cell numbers, leading us to hypothesize that glia may give rise to neurons. After induction of colitis in normal, Nestin-GFP and Sox2-GFP transgenic mice, it was revealed that multiple glial markers (Sox2, Nestin, and CD49b) became strongly expressed by enteric neurons. Immunoselected enteric glia were found to give rise to neurons in culture, and this was inhibited in the presence of 5-HT 4 blockade. Finally, isolated glia gave rise to a neuronal network upon transplantation into aganglionic embryonic avian hindgut. Conclusions: These results show that colitis promotes enteric neurogenesis in the adult colon through a serotonin-dependent mechanism that drives glial cells to transdifferentiate into neurons.

Predators were identified by marks on eggs filled with plaster.Results Ground nests were significantly more depredated, irrespective of the presence of ground cover; tree nests were less depredated in fields with ground cover. There was a clear difference in nest predators of ground and tree nests. Rodents were the most frequent predators of tree nests.Conclusion Lower predation rates of tree nests in orchards with ground cover are probably linked to a change in the foraging behaviour of rodents, which in these more complex habitats might be restricted by rodents' own risk of predation.

This separation of people from nature is an important environmental issue, as it could fundamentally influence the way people value nature and their willingness to conserve it. Here we provide the first experimental study that jointly explores how urban biodiversity can be enhanced and how these changes may influence some aspects of people-biodiversity interactions. We significantly increased the diversity of flowers, birds and pollinators in small public gardens (Paris, France) by providing additional resources (i.e., planting flower-meadows and placing nesting-boxes). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in situ with 1116 regular garden users before and after the manipulation. Close-ended questionnaires were completed exploring the respondents' biodiversity perception and their sensitivity to the changes in biodiversity. Our results highlight a people-biodiversity paradox between people's perceptions and biodiversity awareness. Respondents expressed a strong preference for a rich diversity of species (excluding insects) and related this diversity to their well-being in the gardens. However, they did not notice the diversity of species. Respondents underestimated species richness and only noticed the changes in native flower richness in those gardens where advertisement and public involvement were organized. More experimental interdisciplinary studies are needed to further explore the people-biodiversity interactions. This would help expose the role that urban biodiversity plays in people's daily life and the importance of this interaction for raising public support for general conservation policies.

We investigated the effects of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1Î±) in neurovascular recovery during the postacute phase and downstream signaling pathways, underlying SDF-1Î±-mediated neurovascular recovery. METHODS-: Adult male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion. One week after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the animals received stereotactic injection of adenoassociated virus (AAV) carrying SDF-1Î± gene as treatment or AAV-green fluorescent protein as control and were monitored for 5 weeks. Neurobehavioral outcomes were evaluated, and brain atrophy was measured. Neurogenesis and angiogenesis were examined. The proliferation and migration of neural progenitor cells were evaluated. Downstream pathways of SDF-1Î± were investigated. Inflammatory response was monitored. RESULTS-: Neurobehavioral outcomes were improved, and brain atrophy was greatly reduced for â‰¤5 weeks in AAV-SDF-1Î± groups when compared with the control. SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 was upregulated and colocalized with neural and endothelial progenitor cells. The number of nestin and doublecortin/bromodeoxyuridine cells in the subventricular zone, doublecortin and neuron/bromodeoxyuridine cells in the perifocal region, and cluster of differentiation (CD)31 and bromodeoxyuridine/ CD31 microvessels are also significantly increased in AAV-SDF-1Î± groups.

Some myrmecophytic plants, such as the epiphytic orchid Caularthron bilamellatum, actively form hollow structures that provide nesting space for ants (myrmecodomatia), despite a substantial loss of water-storage tissue. This study aimed at assessing the ability of the orchid to take up nitrogen from ant-inhabited domatia as possible trade-off for the sacrifice of potential water storage capacity.MethodsNitrogen uptake capabilities and uptake kinetics of 15N-labelled compounds (NH 4+, urea and l-glutamine) were studied in field-grown Caularthron bilamellatum plants in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Plants were either labelled directly, by injecting substrates into the hollow pseudobulbs or indirectly, by labelling of the associated ants in situ.Key ResultsCaularthron bilamellatum plants were able to take up all tested inorganic and organic nitrogen forms through the inner surface of the pseudobulbs. Uptake of NH4+ and glutamine followed MichaelisMenten kinetics, but urea uptake was not saturable up to 2 mm. 15N-labelled compounds were rapidly translocated and incorporated into vegetative and reproductive structures. By labelling ants with 15N in situ, we were able to prove that ants transfer N to the plants under field conditions.ConclusionsBased on 15N labelling experiments we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that a myrmecophytic orchid is capable of actively acquiring different forms of nitrogen from its domatia and that nutrient flux from ants to plants does indeed occur under natural conditions. This suggests that beyond anti-herbivore protection host plants benefit from ants by taking up nitrogen derived from ant debris. Â© 2012 The Author.",266,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Our results showed that CNP::EGFP mice were significantly more susceptible to CPZ-induced demyelination, as evaluated by MBP immunostaining, oligodendroglial progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment and astroglial, microglial and nestin response. This enhanced vulnerability was a consequence of their hypomyelination. CNP::EGFP control mice also displayed a significant decrease in corpus callosum (CC) thickness and MBP immunoreactivity. Morphometric analysis further showed a significant decrease in the frequency of myelinated axons, myelin turns (lamellae) and g-ratio carried out in the optic nerve (ON) and CC of CNP::EGFP, as compared to WT mice. Moreover, our results showed a decrease in the number of axons of small caliber, concomitantly with an increase in the number of axons of bigger size with more and enlarged mitochondria, which suggests a high energy demand. These findings and those displaying that MBP+ cells and NF200 staining in the CNP::EGFP cortex were more sparsely distributed provide evidence of axonal loss, which was supported by a decreased number of NeuN+ cells in the CA3 fields of the hippocampus. Transgenic mice also showed an increase in microglial and astroglial activation, accompanied by enhanced lipid peroxidation and recruitment of morphologically altered OPC. Finally, CNPase protein levels proved to be lower than MBP in the CC, which might indicate an altered pattern in myelin proteins with a CNPase deficiency. Behavioral analysis of adult CNP::EGFP transgenic mice supported our results, as it revealed a decrease in locomotion, exploratory activity and motor impairment, as compared to their WT littermates. Our data highlight the relevance of confronting results obtained in adult CNP::EGFP mice with those observed in WT mice. According to our findings, CNP::EGFP hypomyelination might be triggered by the cellular stress induced by the high level of EGFP expression in mature OLG. Adult CNP::EGFP mice could be considered a useful tool to evaluate future therapies for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), since these animals present chronic demyelination with axonal degeneration, a characteristic of such pathologies.

Nestin is also highly expressed in the glomerular podocyte, a type of terminally differentiated epithelial cell. Little is known about the significance of nestin in podocytes. Methods: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was injected into the rats to produce a PAN nephrosis model. Transmission electronic microscopy and terminal dUTP nick end-labeling assay were used to examine the podocyte foot process (FP) effacement and apoptosis, respectively. A mouse podocyte cell line was cultured and incubated with PAN. Immunoblot was used to examine the level of nestin expression both in vivo and in vitro. Enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged plasmids containing nestin shRNA were transfected into the cultured podocytes to silence nestin expression. F-actin arrangement within cultured podocytes was investigated by immunofluorescence, while the apoptosis rate was examined by both Hoechst stain and flow cytometry. Results: In the PAN-induced rat nephrosis model, podocyte nestin expression was increased in the absence of apparent podocyte apoptosis, even though the FP was significantly effaced. In the cultured mouse podocytes, PAN upregulated nestin expression in a time-dependent manner within 24 h of treatment. Notably, no significant apoptosis occurred, however knocking down nestin expression resulted in a remarkable derangement of actin cytoskeleton and an increase in apoptosis in the cultured podocytes 24 h after being incubated with PAN.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effi ciency of the methods used to manage and control the feral pigeon population in Ljubljana. The effectiveness of progesterone, ultrasound deterrent and artifi cial dovecots for egg collection was tested in order to evaluate different approaches to feral pigeon population management in Ljubljana. The most effective method of pigeon control was the use of contraceptives, since the number of pigeons in selected locations of the wider centre of Ljubljana decreased by 49.1% (P>0.05) in the period from 1999 to 2004. The method of ultrasound as a pigeon deterrent remains questionable, since no distinctive deterrent effects were established, even though pigeons in our experiment showed significant (P<0.001) signs of agitation when ultrasound was present in the tested area of the covered passage entrance to the urban land fill in Ljubljana. The method of pigeon nesting in 8 green plot and 2 house attic artificial dovecots, which we are investigating at present, seems to have great potential regarding the egg collecting and consequently the reduction of the number of feral pigeons, improving nesting hygiene and hobby feeding control. After a 10-month period, since the green plot dovecots were built, pigeons have already started to nest in 62% of the available nesting space, however eggs will not be collected until the dovecots are populated completely. The house attic dovecotes were only built recently, so they were still un-populated at the end of this study. We concluded that all the methods used may be only successful in the long term by implementing an integrated approach to pigeon control, specially supported by public information and education.",278,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Currently, neither inorganic nor organic polymers are ideal scaffold materials for spinal cord tissue engineering. The polypeptide with active structure in humor or culture solution could form porous scaffold with coincident visco-elasticity with spinal cord, which may become excellent scaffold material for spinal cord tissue engineering. OBJECTIVE: Mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) were implanted in the surface of self-assembled hydrogel from IKVAV-containing peptide amphiphile (IKVAV-PA) to observe its influence on cell differentiation. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: Contrast observation at cellular level. The experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from October to November 2006. MATERIALS: Polypeptide sequence C 16H31O-A3G4D2IKVAV (Mw = 1 438.31, purity=96.06%) was self-made. Neonatal mice were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. METHODS: NSCs harvested from the cerebral cortex of neonatal mice were dissociated mechanically and cultivated in serum-free media; three-dimensional self-assembly hydrogel from 1wt% amphiphilic peptide was formed with addition of DMEM/F12. NSCs at density of 1Ã—108/L were respectively incubated in the surface of hydrogel (experimental group) and the coverslips covered with polylysine (control group) for two weeks, and were examined immunocytochemically. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Isolated cells were immunohistochemically examined for nestin, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); hydrogel nanofiber morphology was observed. Expression of nestin, NSE and GFAP of the hydrogel surface was detected. RESULTS: The nestin-positive cells obtained were able to be differentiated into NSE-positive neurons and GFAP-positive glial cells; transmission electron microscope showed that the hydrogel was composed of nanofiber network, their diameter ranging from 3 to 6 nm and the length from 100 nm to 1.5 Î¼m; The cells had processes after seven days of incubation, and neurofilament-positive neuron-like cells labeled with red fluorescence and GFAP-positive glial-like cells with green fluorescence were found in experimental group. However, only undifferentiated nestin-positive neurospheres labeled with green fluorescence were found in control group. CONCLUSION: The three-dimensional self-assembled hydrogel from IKVAV-PA has good compatibility with NSCs, and capacity to induce NSCs to differentiate into neurons and glial cells.",287,1,"excluded","Out of field"

To clarify this issue, blood samples from 109 yellow-whiskered greenbuls Andropadus latirostris were investigated using both the microscopic examination of blood films and a nested mitochondrial cytochrome b PCR. The overall prevalence of Leucocytozoon spp. infection was 4 after the standard microscopic examination and 17 using the PCR diagnostics. Samples from 9 randomly chosen birds that were microscopy negative, but PCR positive, were then examined microscopically by screening 2 entire blood films from each individual bird.

Blue egg coloration has been suggested as a sexually selected signal of female quality to males, and some recent studies are in accordance with this hypothesis. Blue eggshell coloration results from the deposition of biliverdin pigment by laying females, which is a potent antioxidant. Thus, egg pigmentation should be costly in terms of antioxidants, an assumption of the signaling hypothesis that has not been tested yet. We induced increased reproductive effort in a set of female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca through nest removal and measured egg pigmentation and plasma antioxidant levels in relation with a control group. Experimental females showed a negative association between egg color and plasma antioxidant levels, while there was no relationship for control birds. This supports that egg pigmentation is costly in terms of general antioxidant defenses and suggests a tradeoff between the allocations to both traits. Furthermore, experimental females with more colorful eggs raised more fledglings, especially when breeding early. Controls did not show a relationship between egg color and reproductive success. Females laying more colorful eggs could have shifted their allocation decisions towards current reproduction, at the expense of their own antioxidant defenses. Our results highlight that blue egg coloration is a life-history trait, subject to tradeoffs with other attributes, and seems to be especially informative under harsh breeding conditions.

By modulating the allograft treatment modality we were able to study migratory, denervated, rejecting, and reinnervated phenotypes in transgenic mice whose SCs expressed GFP under regulatory elements of either the S100b (S100-GFP) or nestin (Nestin-GFP) promoters. Well-differentiated SCs strongly expressed S100-GFP, while Nestin-GFP expression was stimulated by denervation, and in some cases, axons were constitutively labeled with CFP to enable in vivo imaging. Serial imaging of these mice demonstrated that untreated allografts were rejected within 20Â days. Cold preserved (CP) allografts required an initial phase of SC migration that preceded axonal regeneration thus delaying myelination and maturation of the SC phenotype. Mice immunosuppressed with FK506 demonstrated mild subacute rejection, but the most robust regeneration of myelinated and unmyelinated axons and motor endplate reinnervation. While characterized by fewer regenerating axons, mice treated with the co-stimulatory blockade (CSB) agents anti-CD40L mAb and CTLAIg-4 demonstrated virtually no graft rejection during the 28Â day experiment, and had significant increases in myelination, connexin-32 expression, and Akt phosphorylation compared with any other group. These results indicate that even with SC rejection, nerve regeneration can occur to some degree, particularly with FK506 treatment.

The consequences and underlying reasons for this behaviour have not been evaluated, and it is unclear whether nests in mistletoes confer advantages compared with other available substrates. Nest predation is often cited as the most important factor regulating many bird populations and is thought to influence all aspects of nest-site selection. To evaluate whether nest predation may play a role in the widespread use of mistletoe as a nest-site, we conducted an artificial nest predation experiment in a eucalypt woodland in southern New South Wales, Australia. Artificial nests were modelled on noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus: Meliphagidae) nests, baited with a single quail egg and checked after four days. We used logistic regression to model the rate of depredation between plant substrates, and demonstrate that, in this experiment, mistletoe nests experienced a lower proportion of predation than eucalypt nests (51.5% versus 63.8% respectively). This finding suggests that predation may influence the widespread use of mistletoe as a nest-site in a range of habitats and regions. In addition to clarifying priorities for further work on mistletoe nesting, this finding has implications for studies of nest-site selection generally, with researchers encouraged to supplement between-substrate comparisons with direct measurements of within-substrate variation.

On the basis of the predicted chicken NTE gene middle sequence and its 3â€²-end cDNA sequence, we cloned the gene sequence of chicken NTE activity domain (cNEST). The cloned cNEST gene is 1740 base pairs and encodes 579 amino acids, showing high identity with human and mouse NEST at amino acid level. The serine hydrolase signature motif GXSXG and the patatin domain were found in the cNEST sequence. Over-expression of cNEST tagged with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) in monkey kidney COS7 cells increased NTE activity significantly. The increased extent is similar to that in over-expression of hNEST cells. Moreover, over-expression of cNEST led to an accumulation of partial cNEST on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Partial cNEST located in the cytoplasm by comparing the distribution of cNEST and hNEST. After inhibition with different concentrations of mipafox for 60 min, the calculated I50 value was 4.95 Î¼M for COS7 cells over-expressing cNEST.

Materials and Methods: Parents of 73 paediatric cancer patients treated at KK Women's & Children's Hospital completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data about the types of CAM therapies used, motivations for use, adverse effects, costs and discussion of usage with the patient's physician were obtained. General perceptions towards CAM and conventional medicine were explored. A subsequent telephone survey enquired about spirituality, benefits of CAM use and overall satisfaction with the therapies. Results: Two-thirds of patients used at least 1 CAM treatment, mainly as supportive adjuncts to conventional cancer treatment. Dietary changes, health supplements, herbal tea and bird's nest were the most common therapies used. Few patients (8.1%) consulted a CAM practitioner.

Nitrogen, which is required in the greatest quantity of all mineral nutrients absorbed by plant roots, is an essential component of protein. While the beneficial effects of fertilizer N application on crop production are well documented, concern on the long-term role of fertilizer N in maintaining soil productivity, crop quality (including elemental composition and balance, protein, oil, fatty acids), and environmental safety is being expressed more frequently in recent years. The long-term strategy of N use in agriculture likely will involve increased reliance on fertilizer N, biological N fixation (BNF) by leguminous crops, and wastes (including farm, urban, and industrial wastes) and their efficient management. Recovery of applied N by crops in field experiments has been found commonly ranging from 25 to 34% for rice (Oryza sativa L.) and 40 to 60% for other crops, with the global average value of about 50% (Mosier, 2002). Unutilized N may remain in the soil in various forms and/or get lost through several processes, including NH3 volatilization, denitrification, and nitrate leaching, which have been discussed in detail in several reviews (Aulakh et al., 1992; Carpenter et al., 1998; Goulding, 2004; Guillard et al., 1995; Malhi et al., 1991, 2002a; Singh et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995). For enhancing applied nitrogen use efficiency by crops (NUE), several management techniques have been developed for different soils, crops, seasons, and regions. Examples of these include (a) integrated and judicious use of chemical fertilizers and organic manures, (b) synchronizing N supply with crop need by split applications during crop growth, (c) reducing loss of applied N with nest or band placement or large urea granules in soil, and (d) use of slow-release fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors (Aulakh, 1994; Keeney, 1982; Malhi and Nyborg, 1985, 1988; Nyborg and Malhi, 1992). The amounts of different nutrients absorbed by a crop from soil may vary 10,000-fold, from 200 kg of N ha-1 to less than 20 g of Mo ha-1, and yet rarely do these nutrients work in isolation. As agriculture becomes more intensive, the extent and severity of nutrient deficiencies and the practical significance of nutrient interactions increase. Interactions among nutrients occur when the supply of one nutrient affects the absorption, distribution, or function of another nutrient (Robson and Pitman, 1983). In crop production, nutrient interactions assume added significance by affecting crop productivity and returns from investments made by farmers in fertilizers. Interaction between two or more nutrients can be positive (synergistic), negative (antagonistic), or even absent (reflected as additive effect). When the effect of one factor (e.g., nutrient) is influenced by the effect of another factor, the two factors are said to interact. When the crop yield reaches an early plateau, it may be due to the limiting supplies of another nutrient illustrating the operation of Liebig's ""law of the minimum"" (Cooke and Gething, 1978). When that nutrient is supplied, yield will continue to increase until another factor becomes limiting. When solar radiation, temperature, and soil water availability are nonlimiting, plant nutrient requirements will be higher; for which Wallace (1990) proposed the ""law of the maximum"" in contrast to the ""law of minimum."" The law of maximum states that when the need is fully satisfied for every factor involved in the process, the rate of the process can be at its maximum potential, which is greater than the sum of its parts because of a sequentially additive interaction (Wallace, 1990). Production of field crops has already entered into the stage of multiple nutrient deficiencies management. For instance, in south Asia, a farmer in the rice-wheat belt needs to manage four to six nutrients to safeguard and sustain an annual harvest of 10 tons grain ha-1, whereas a tea planter in India targeting for a yield of over 4.5 tons tea ha-1 must worry about seven to eight nutrients. Thus, when the combined effect of two factors is more than their additive effects, the interaction is positive. When their combined effect is less than their additive effects, the interaction is negative. Therefore, just because factor A + factor B plot produces a higher yield than either A-treated or B-treated plot does not mean that there is a positive A Ã— B interaction. A brief review on the interaction effects of N with P, K, S, and Cu has been given previously (Aulakh and Malhi, 2004). As N function in plant growth and nutrition is closely connected to C, the C/N ratio controls N availability and potentially affects interactions through the processes of organic residue decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) formation in soil, biomass production (photosynthesis minus respiration) in plant, and energy flow in and through all levels of the ecosystem (Wilkinson et al., 2000). An understanding of the nature of different interactions, factors affecting them, and the ways and means of managing these for useful purposes is vital for developing, advocating, and practicing a balanced and efficient crop nutrient management strategy. Identification and exploitation of positive interactions hold the key for increasing returns in terms of crop yield, produce quality, and nutrient use efficiency from applied N. Knowledge of the negative interactions is equally valuable because the test of ""precision crop nutrition"" lies in the ability to minimize the losses from antagonistic effects. Nutrient interactions have a role to play in determining the course and outcome of two major issues of interest in fertilizer management, namely balanced fertilizer input and efficient fertilizer use. This article reviews and analyzes the available information to (a) examine the impact of interactions of applied N with other nutrients, nutrient cycles, and water on NUE, (b) consider the influence of NUE on the utilization of other nutrients and water, and on C sequestration and storage in soil, (c) compute relative consumption of major fertilizer nutrients (N, P, and K) for assessing their over, under, or balanced use in different regions, and (d) pinpoint the gaps in knowledge for future research needs to optimize the use of N and other nutrients for sustainable crop production and reducing environmental risks. The fertilizer use efficiency indicators considered in this chapter are (i) agronomic efficiency calculated as production of grain over control per unit of applied fertilizer nutrient (Novoa and Loomis, 1981), (ii) improvement in nutrient uptake as measured by apparent recovery efficiency, namely uptake of fertilizer nutrient by plant over control per unit of applied fertilizer nutrient (Dilz, 1988), and (iii) improvement in crop quality parameters such as protein, oil, and fatty acid content. Similarly, water use efficiency (WUE) computed as (i) crop yield m-2 field area m-1 water used and (ii) crop yield m-2 field area m-1 water transpiration or evapotranspiration is considered here. As the impacts can be on a local, regional, or global scale, examples have been cited for different levels. Emphasis is placed on the cereal crops that occupy more than 50% of the harvested area of crop land and contribute more than 75% to annual world food production, but other field crops, such as oilseeds and pulses, vegetables, horticultural crops, and perennials are also discussed. Keeping the practical utility of research in view, a preference has been accorded to results obtained from field experiments over greenhouse and pot culture studies. Â© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Although lightning-ignited fires were infrequent, the California Indians used fire to modify oak woodland vegetation for at least 3,000 yr. These high-frequency, low-intensity fires likely resulted in little mortality of mature oaks, low but continuous tree recruitment, an open understory, and a fine-grained mosaic of vegetation patches. Following settlement by Europeans in the mid-1800s, ranchers burned to reduce shrub cover and to increase grassland area and forage production; surface fires were common with average fire-return intervals of 8-15 yr. Fire suppression, begun in the 1940s to 1950s, led to increases in surface and crown fuels, invasion of woody vegetation in the understory, and increased tree density. In the absence of demonstrated fire effects on oak woodland birds, we used changes in vegetation structure expected to result from fire and fire suppression to predict the response of oak woodland birds to fire and fire suppression based on nesting habitat of 17 common oak woodland species breeding at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, California. Our results suggest that populations of Western Kingbirds (Tyrannus verticalis), Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and Violet-green Swallows (Tachycineta thalassina), would increase in abundance following fire, because they consistently nested in habitat similar to that expected to result from frequent, low-intensity fire. The species predicted to respond negatively to changes resulting from fire differed among the variables examined. If fire produces a mosaic of habitat patches rather than a homogeneous landscape, we expect that the differing habitat needs of most species will be provided for. As with fire, the most obvious change resulting from excluding livestock was an increase in shrub cover. The question naturally arises to what extent livestock grazing creates habitat similar to that created by historical fire, but this question remains unstudied. More fire-history research is needed to understand past fire regimes of oak woodlands and the effects of fire, including prescribed fire, on the vegetation and the bird community. The effects of grazing and the extent to which grazing mimics fire clearly require more study. We encourage others to test our hypotheses regarding responses of birds to variables expected to be altered by fire: shrub cover, tree density, and numbers of snags, saplings, and logs.

We examined the inner ear of mice at the following postnatal days (P): P0, P4, P5, P15 and P60. Hair cells stereocilia were identified with the use of the histochemical marker phalloidin. Whole endorgans or cryosections were analyzed under epi-fluorescent or confocal microscopy. From P0 to P5, GFP expressing cells were found in the vestibular sensory epithelia of the macula utricle, but not in the crista ampullaris. Cells within the stroma (tissue underneath the sensory epithelia), utricle, and crista were also GFP-positive. Satellite cells in the vestibular ganglia were GFP-positive, while vestibular ganglia neurons were not. In the organ of Corti, GFP signal was found in inner border and inner phalangeal cells that surround the inner hair cells (GFP-negative), Dieters cells and cells in the great epithelial ridge. Outer hair cells were mildly positive for GFP. Satellite cells in the spiral ganglia were GFP-positive, while spiral ganglia neurons were not. Similar GFP expression was found in the vestibule and cochlea of animals at P15, however, outer hair cells showed no GFP expression. The inner ear of P60 animals contained moderate GFP expression in the stroma of the crista ampullaris and utricle, but not within the sensory epithelia. In the organ of Corti, moderate GFP expression was found in a few Deiters cells. The present data indicates that the expression of nestin in the mouse inner ear is developmentally regulated; yet in the adult inner ear there are some nestin expressing cells, suggesting an intrinsic repair potential, although to a more limited extent than during early post-natal life.

In a sample of 2,881 nest records collected by the lay public from 1959 to 1991, we examined whether clutch size has also responded to climate change. We found that clutch size is strongly related to lay date, both within and among years, and there has been no significant temporal variation in the slopes or intercepts of the clutch-size/lay-date regressions. As a consequence, we expected increases in clutch size with advancement in lay date; however, we detected no such trend over time. The distributions of egg-laying dates were more constricted in the warmest (and earliest) years, suggesting that changes in mean clutch size might be constrained by changes in the distribution of laying dates. If spring temperatures continue to increase, we predict further reductions of variance in laying dates and relatively small increases in clutch size. Such constraints on life-history variation probably are common and need to be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on reproduction in natural populations.

Grazing by geese on Carex ramenskii, one of the most abundant plant species throughout much of this region, appears to have increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was (i) to evaluate the effects of early-season defoliation and fertilization on plant growth and nutrient cycling processes within field plots of C. ramenskii over a 3-year period, and (ii) to study the interactive effects of defoliation, N availability, and salinity stress on growth, and biomass and N allocation in C. ramenskii under controlled, greenhouse conditions. Relative to control plots, clipped-fertilized plots showed significant increases in aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and leaf N concentration, resulting in significant increases in offtake biomass and offtake N during both 1991 and 1992. In the greenhouse, total production of clipped and unclipped plants did not differ, but clipped plants had significantly higher offtake biomass, and biomass and N allocation to offtake compared to undipped plants. Both field and laboratory experiments found that rapid regrowth following defoliation was dependent on soil nutrient availability. Fertilization increased soil respiration rates each year, but tended to decrease rates of net N mineralization, indicating that the soil microbial biomass is a strong nutrient sink in this ecosystem. In addition to the direct positive effects that goose feces have on plant growth, nitrogen recycled through feces may be an important source of nitrogen contributing to salinity tolerance in C. ramenskii. Our results also suggest that the observed increase in grazing pressure on patches of C. ramenskii early in the growing season may increase forage quality and quantity within these swards, and have important implications for geese-ecosystem interactions at a time of rapid goose population increase.",336,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Males also sang more songs in the nestbox and flew more to the nestbox with green nest material. During male presentations, only the time spent at the nestbox and the carrying of nest material increased significantly. Males spent more time at the nestbox, sang more songs and more song types in response to a female stimulus than to a male stimulus. Males also sang more songs in the nestbox and flew more to the nestbox with nest material during female than during male presentations. These results suggest that the song and song repertoire of male starlings serve primarily an intersexual rather than an intrasex- ual function.

Alternatively, egg coloration may be selectively neutral because nest predators detect nests and not eggs, or it may be maladaptive because organisms are not always well adapted to their present environment. I evaluated these hypotheses by studying predation on artificial song thrush (Turdus philomelos) nests with quail eggs, painted either white, blue, or spotted (cryptic to a human eye). Corvids were the major nest predators. For concealed as well as exposed nests, I found no differences in the predation rates of nests with white, blue, or spotted eggs. Predators apparently detected the nests, and not the eggs, first. In a second experiment, I placed egg groups without nests in trees to study the effect of color per se. The predation rate of the spotted egg groups was significantly lower than that of the white and blue egg groups, for concealed as well as exposed egg groups.

Sediment pore water and bulk sediments from several lower Fox River sites were toxic to a number of test species including Pimephales promelas, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Hexagenia limbata, Selenastrum capricornutum, and Photobacterium phosphorum. An important component of the observed toxicity appeared to be due to ammonia. Evaluation of three bullhead (Ictalurus) species from the lower Fox River revealed an absence of preneoplastic or neoplastic liver lesions, and the Salmonella typhimurium bioassay indicated relatively little mutagenicity in sediment extracts. Apparent adverse reproductive effects were noted in two species of birds nesting along the lower Fox River and on a confined disposal facility for sediments near the mouth of the river, and there were measurable concentrations of potentially toxic 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) both in the birds and in sediments from several of the study sites.

We manipulated green nesting material and ectoparasites of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to test two hypotheses: (1) ectoparasites adversely affect prefledging survival and morphometrics or postfledging survival, and (2) green nesting material ameliorates the effects of ectoparasites. We recorded fat score, numbers of scabs, tarsal length, body mass, and hematocrit level on each nestling 17 days after hatching. We also fitted each nestling with unique patagial tags and resighted the starlings for 6-8 weeks after fledging to estimate survival and sighting rates. Nests devoid of green nesting material and dusted with the insecticide, carbaryl, had fewer high ectoparasite infestations, and nestlings had significantly lower scab scores, and significantly higher body masses than nestlings in undusted boxes. However, there was no difference in postfledging survival between birds from carbaryl-treated and undusted nests. There also was no difference in prefledging survival and morphometrics or postfledging survival between nestlings from boxes with and without green nesting material. These results do not support the hypothesis that starlings use green nesting material to control nest ectoparasites.

Experiments presented here examined the specific egg parameters to which 'rejecter species' respond, the relative tolerances rejecters show towards nonmimetic eggs and the degree to which rejection is limited to eggs of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), the only parasitic bird widespread in North America. Relative to cowbird eggs, American robin (Turdus migratorius) eggs are larger, blue rather than white and immaculate rather than spotted. Experiments using 10 egg models at 137 nests showed that robins respond to each of these differences (Figs. 2 and 3) but do not usually reject an egg that deviates from their own by only one difference. Eggs that differ in ant two of the three parameters are usually rejected. This built-in tolerance reduces the likelihood that robins will reject their own eggs if these are atypical in size or coloration. Small egg size was the most important parameter eliciting rapid rejections (i.e. within 1 day), probably because differnces in size can be detected by both visual and tactile perception. By contrast, small egg size was the least important parameter determining whether eggs were eventually rejected (i.e. within 5 days, Tables 2 and 3). In terms of their eventual response, robins may be more sensitive to egg coloration than to size because the latter parameter is less reliable in distinguishing between robin and cowbird eggs. Experiments were also carried out at 37 nests of the gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), whose immaculate blue-green egg is only slightly larger than a cowbird egg. Catbirds are much more responsive to white ground color than to maculation (Table 4), perhaps because color is more reliable in distinguishing between catbird and cowbird eggs. Rejecter species exhibit degrees of tolerance towards foreign eggs that are proportional to the divergence between their eggs and those of the cowbird. Birds with eggs strongly divergent from cowbird eggs benefit from being relatively tolerant because they avoid rejecting their own eggs but still act against cowbird eggs. Species with cowbird-like eggs must be relatively intolerant to maximize the chances that cowbird eggs are rejected. Experiments show that rejection is not specific to cowbird eggs. Thus, birds have apparently responded evolutionarily to brood parasitism by developing recognition of their own eggs, rather than by developing recognition and rejection specific to parasitic eggs.

Investigations during 1965-68 attempted to study possible interactions existing between sheep and shearwaters on Big Green I., Furneaux Group, Tas. The island has been stocked with sheep for more than 100 years and during this period changes in vegetation and decreases in colony size have been noted. Exclusion of sheep from a portion of a colony did not increase hatching or fledging success, nor was there a decline in either the number of burrows or in burrow utilization, in the sheep-trampled areas. Indeed, sheep activity over colonies appeared to decline during the birds' breeding season and it was concluded that burrow damage was due mainly to the birds themselves, with major damage occurring in the fenced area during the breeding season. Comparison of burrow stability on Green Island with that in another colony, again suggested that birds were responsible for nest destruction but that renovation by the birds tended to nullify the importance of the damage. Though shearwater colonies were once considered to be more widespread on Green Island, experiments have indicated that the vegetation, induced by man and perpetuated by sheep, was not preventing burrow formation and expansion of colony areas. Sheep have not, therefore, been shown to be responsible for past declines and other factors will be considered later. Â© 1970, CSIRO. All rights reserved.",381,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

The Hawfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbill live primarily in woodland, the Greenfinch, Linnet and Goldfinch primarily in farmland, while the Bullfinch and Chaffinch breed, and occur throughout the year, in both these habitats. Habitat differences between species were probably more marked in primeval England than now, and the problems of studying animals in manâ€�modified environments are discussed in this context. Diet was studied by observation and by gutâ€�analyses of live and dead finches. Before roosting, finches usually accumulate food in their gullet, which is expandable but otherwise undifferentiated (the term â€œcropâ€� is thus inappropriate). The Lesser Redpoll, the smallest species studied, can store up to about 0.8 c.c. of food in its gullet, but the Greenfinch, one of the largest finches, up to 2.5 c.c. Among the Carduelis finches, the Greenfinch lives mainly on the large seeds of various trees, cereal crops and agricultural weeds; the Goldfinch on the seeds of Compositae; the Siskin on alder and conifer seeds; the Lesser Redpoll on birch and other small seeds; and the Linnet on the seeds of various weeds of farmland. The Hawfinch and Bullfinch eat a greater proportion of buds and seeds from fleshy fruits than do other finches; but the Hawfinch prefers larger ones than does the Bullfinch. The three European crossbills feed almost entirely on conifer seeds; specializing on different tree species. In summer, the Chaffinch and Brambling live largely on invertebrates but in winter on beechmast or small seeds taken from the ground. In winter, Chaffinches reaching Britain from northern Europe tend to feed in large flocks in open areas and to roost communally, while residents tend to remain near their breeding places and roost singly. The migrations and distribution of finches in Europe are described briefly. At any time of winter, closely related species with similar feeding habits are often concentrated in different parts of a common wintering range. Furthermore, in some species, such as the Goldfinch and Chaffinch, the sexes winter mainly in different areas. In Oxford, food was least readily available during hard (winter) weather and there was then complete segregation in diet between different species, but at other times their diets often overlapped considerably. The overlap was much more pronounced in the species living in farmland (which is an artificial habitat) than in those living in natural or seminatural woodland; some tentative explanations for this are offered. The fringilline finches, the Chaffinch and Brambling, feed their young entirely on invertebrates, are territorial in the breeding season and collect food mostly within their territories. The cardueline finches, on the other hand, feed their young mainly, or entirely, on seeds, often nest in â€œloose coloniesâ€� and usually gather food communally at some distance from their nests. The fringilline finches carry food in their bills to the young, which therefore receive small, but frequent, meals; whereas the carduelines feed their young by regurgitation and at longer intervals. Among the carduelines, the Hawfinch is exceptional in that seeds are first swallowed and regurgitated to the nestlings, whereas insects are carried in the bill. The Bullfinch develops in the breeding season special buccal pouches in which food is carried to the young. In general, most finches select diets for their young which differ from their own diets in the breeding season. The Crossbill and Linnet often feed their young on seeds alone, and some other species may do so occasionally. The breeding of these carduelines is therefore independent of a supply of invertebrates, but always coincides with an abundance of seeds. They breed at seasons when other birds do not; the most extreme cases are the three crossbills, which, given an abundance of suitable seeds, will nest at any time of year. The process of seedâ€�husking is described; the strength of the jaws, the extent of the gape and the width of the palatal grooves limit the size and hardness of seeds which a given species can take. No two species have bills of the same shape and size, and differences in diet between species are connected with differences in the structure of their bills and the way the bill is used. In general, the deeper the bill of a finch, the more numerous the types of seeds in its diet. The Greenfinch, Linnet and Redpoll have relatively short broad bills and feed more than do other Carduelis finches from plants whose seeds are relatively exposed (e.g. grasses) or enclosed within pods or capsules; they also pick up many fallen seeds from the ground, but each species concentrates on different sizes of seeds. The Goldfinch and Siskin have reIatively long, narrow bills and obtain much of their food by probing into cones and into the seedâ€�heads of Comâ€�positae; unlike other finches, they also use a gaping movement while feeding. The Goldfinch has a longer bill and eats more Compositae seeds than the Siskin, while tlie latter eats more tree seeds than the Goldfinch. Further, male Goldfinches have slightly longer beaks than females, and hence can obtain teasel seeds more efficiently; females feed only rarely from these plants. The Bullfinch and Hawfinch obtain much of their food by crushing fruits, seedâ€�heads, etc. in their bills and peeling off the outer layer to get the seeds. The methods used by the crossbill species to open cones of varying degrees of hardness are described in detail. The Chaffinch and Brambling obtain almost all their food by rapid pecks; they show none of the behaviour patterns used by carduelines to open various types of seedâ€�heads. Species also differ in the proportion of food obtained from the ground, from vegetation, or on the wing. These differences are related to the various positions in which each species is able to feed. Those species (Goldfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbills) which are most adept at clinging and hanging feed mainly from trees and herbaceous plants, while those that are least adept at this (Chaffinch and Brambling) obtain almost all their food from the ground or from firm horizontal twigs. The remaining species are intermediate in the proportion of time spent feeding from the ground or from vegetation; and only the Chaffinch, Brambling and Bullfinch obtain an appreciable amount of food on the wing. Differences between species in the frequency with which various positions are adopted during feeding can be related to differences in their average body weights, and (to a lesser extent) in their legâ€�structure; the most agile species are either light in weight or have relatively short strong legs. Bodyâ€�weight, legâ€�proportions and billâ€�size (and hence feeding habits) may vary considerably between different populations of the same species. In Appendix 2, the legâ€�proportions of certain English finches are compared with those of their German and Russian counterparts. Some finch species use their feet in coordination with their bill to obtain food. The extent to which various species do this in the wild is discussed in relation to the ease with which they can be taught experimentally to pull up food suspended on the end of a long thread. The ecology, structure and behaviour of finches is discussed in relation to some current ideas on speciation and the ontogeny of feeding behaviour. The young of several species of finches respond initially to a similar range of potential foodâ€�items (both in size and appearance) and all attempt to deal with them in similar ways. However, each individual soon learns to concentrate on those foods it can obtain most efficiently with its own particular structures and behaviour patterns. It is thus the structural and behavioural differences between closelyâ€�related species which lead the individuals of each to prefer different foods. Further, some of the behaviour patterns themselves probably develop mainly as a result of learning conditioned by structure, so that some of the behavioural differences between species that affect foodâ€�choice are in turn dependent on structural differences. This implies that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, two forms need diverge only in structure (and not necessarily â€œpsychologicallyâ€�) for some ecological segregation to be achieved. There are, however, certain differences in feeding behaviour between the fringillines and carduelines that cannot be attributed merely to structural differences between the two groups, so presumably some â€œpsychological factorâ€� is also important in the development of these particular behaviour patterns. A close relationship between the structure, feeding behaviour and food of an animal is usually taken for granted, but it is often difficult to decide which of these came first in evolution. Among finches, however, there are sometimes indications that a structural change was necessary before a new behaviour pattern or feeding habit could evolve, though further modification of structure may then occur through adaptation to the new foods thereby made available. Some evolutionary trends among finches are described, and the role of competition in the evolution and maintenance of ecological differences between species is discussed. The effect of social experience on feeding behaviour is also discussed, and some examples are given of the spread of novel foodâ€�habits among finches, and of presumed traditional differences in feeding behaviour between different populations of the same species. Finally, some recent changes in food, and habitatâ€�selection by finches are discussed in relation to problems of conservation. Copyright Â© 1967, Wiley Blackwell.

Virus-associated tumours grow best, followed by the chemically induced tumours. The majority of spontaneous tunours give disappointingly small growths. It has been shown that the capacity for inducing ectodermal proliferation in the chorioallantois is not confined to tumour viruses, or to fowl pox and other non-tumour associated viruses, but occurs in the membranes adjacent to the majority of implanted tumours, whether spontaneous, virus associated, or chemically induced; or even occasionally in response to bacterial growth. Attention has been drawn to the tendency of the proliferating ectoderm to form â€œcell nestsâ€� or â€œepithelial pearls,â€� resembling those occurring in squamous-cell carcinoma, and the significance of this has been discussed. The induction has been described of two distinct leukaemic conditions in chick embryos as the result of implanting tissues from a third type of spontaneous leukaemia in a fowl, and has been briefly discussed. I wish to express my gratitude to Professor A. Murray Drennan, of the Pathology Department, University of Edinburgh, for his interest in this work, and for the numerous suggestions as to the manner of development of the investigation. All the fertile eggs were obtained from Dr. A. W. Greenwood's flock of Brown Leghorns, and I have pleasure in recording my appreciation of his co-operation in this respect, and for much help in other directions. The virus associated and chemically induced tumours were supplied by Dr. J. G. Carr, formerly of the Institute of Animal Genetics, University of Edinburgh, to whom I am much indebted. The histological preparations were the work of Messrs. Cockburn and Mac-Kenzie. Part of the expenses incurred by this work were borne by the British Empire Cancer Campaign.
