F. and Diamantino, Fernanda and Rabaca, Joao E. and Merino, Santiago",AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH,13,3,44-48,2020,10.1177/1758155920921075,"Some passerines incorporate aromatic plants in their nest cups, and several hypotheses have been formulated to explain this behaviour. One of those, the Drug Hypothesis, states that aromatic plants present in nests have positive effects on nestlings' development through increased immune function. In this study, we aimed to examine if experimental addition of aromatic plants had positive effects on reproductive performance (the number of fledglings produced and nestling survival rate) and nestling development (weight and tarsus length). In addition, we study whether those potential effects were more noticeable in different brood sizes-small and large-through an observational approach. We expect that large broods, due to increased resource competition between nestlings, will benefit more from aromatic plant incorporation, as compared to small broods. Nestlings were significantly heavier in 2015 as compared to 2016 and 2017 and in small broods. No effect of treatment was observed in nestling weight. Although there was no overall effect of treatment on nestling tarsus length, nestlings from aromatic nests had significantly longer tarsi as compared to nestlings from control nests, in large broods.",2,2,selected,

Several studies however suggest that passerines can perceive volatile compounds in several biologically relevant contexts. In Corsica, recent findings suggest that cavity-nesting blue tits may use volatile compounds in the context of nest building and maintenance. Although they build their nests mainly from moss, female blue tits also frequently incorporate fragments of several species of aromatic plants in the nest cup. In field experiments, breeding female blue tits altered their nest maintenance behaviour in response to experimental addition of aromatic plants in their nest. In aviary experiments. captive male blue tits could be trained to detect lavender odour from a distance. Here I report results from a field study aimed to test whether adult blue tits altered their chick-feeding behaviour after an experimental change in nest odour composition. I experimentally added fragments of aromatic plant species that differed from those brought in the nests before the start of the experiment in a set of experimental nests and added moss, the basic nest material, in a set of control nests. Both male and female blue tits hesitated significantly longer entering the nest cavity after addition of new aromatic plant fragments, as compared to moss addition. This response was especially observed during the first visit following the experimental change in nest plant composition. Nest composition treatment had no effect on the time spent in the nest. This study demonstrates that free-ranging blue tits detect changes in nest odour from outside the nest cavity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",3,2,selected,

Empirical research on the potential role of nests or nest features as sexual signals, however, is comparatively scarce for avian species in which the female is the only sex involved in its construction because of a male bias in the study of sexual traits, even though maternally built nests may be more common than paternally and biparentally built nests. In blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, females alone build nests and add aromatic plants to them. We manipulated nest size and amount of aromatic plants in the nest to assess subsequent male effort and risk taking during provisioning of nestlings as indices of differential allocation. Risk taking was assessed through trappability indices of males at the nest-box when provisioning nestlings. Although male provisioning rates did not differ between experimental groups, male risk taking during provisioning was significantly lower in nests reduced in size than in control and enlarged nests, and it was significantly higher in nests supplied with aromatic plants than in control nests. Females showed nonsignificant trends to increase their provisioning effort in reduced nests, probably to compensate reduced male investment. Finally, female provisioning rates and especially male risk taking had a major positive impact on reproductive success and thereby on female fitness. In summary, this study (and previous evidence) suggests that nest size and aromatic plants in blue tit nests are used by females as sexual signals to elicit differential allocation in males. This study adds to the scarce evidence in favor of nests or nest materials acting as sexually selected traits regarding female signaling. Â© 2013 The Author.

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration.

A recent experiment has successfully manipulated male investment by placing dummy eggs simulating the extremes in the blue-green natural reflectance. Here we have substituted one egg in certain pied flycatcher clutches with a single deep-blue (blue) or light-blue (pale) dummy egg and used other clutches as controls. Blue dummy eggs reflected more in the blue-green part of the spectrum than natural and pale dummy eggs, which were similar in reflectance. Nestlings in nests with one blue dummy egg during laying and incubation attained a significantly higher mass and condition than those in nests with one pale dummy egg or in control broods, when controlling for phenology, brood size and blue-green chroma of the clutch. Only a shift in parental investment can have induced this highly significant effect. Preference for deeply coloured clutches associated with high-quality females and their maternal effects may explain stimulation by a single supernormal stimulus emanating from multiple objects like clutches.

In vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs. Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival. Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link environmental conditions to population productivity and viability.

Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.",43,1,excluded,no green nest material

Fraser and Morphew, Alex R. and Kjaer, Esben L.",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,86,2,NA,2022,10.1002/jwmg.22188,"The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a primary tool for restoring grassland in the United States, in part as wildlife habitat, which has benefited declining grassland bird populations. Among potential mid-contract management practices used to maintain early-successional CRP grasslands, cattle grazing had been prohibited and is currently disincentivized during the primary nesting season for birds (much of the growing season), despite the important role that large herbivores historically played in structuring grassland ecosystems. Conservative grazing of CRP grasslands could increase spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure and plant diversity, potentially supporting higher densities of some grassland bird species and higher bird diversity. Our objective was to determine the effect of experimental cattle grazing on species-specific relative abundance and occupancy, species diversity, and community dissimilarity of grassland birds on CRP grasslands across the longitudinal extent of Kansas, USA (a 63.5-cm precipitation gradient) during the 2017-2019 avian breeding seasons. Fifty-three of 108 fields were grazed by cattle during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 and all fields were rested from grazing in 2019. For all analyses, we examined separate model sets for semiarid western versus more mesic eastern Kansas. Using data from line transect surveys, we modeled relative abundances of 5 songbird species: grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), dickcissel (Spiza americana), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Grazing had delayed yet positive effects on abundances of grasshopper sparrow in western Kansas, and eastern meadowlark in eastern Kansas, but negative effects on dickcissel abundance in western Kansas and especially on burned fields in eastern Kansas. Somewhat counterintuitively, brown-headed cowbirds in western Kansas were more abundant on ungrazed versus grazed fields in the years after grazing began. In addition, we modeled multi-season occupancy of 3 gamebird species (ring-necked pheasant {[}Phasianus colcicus], northern bobwhite {[}Colinus virginianus], mourning dove [}Zenaida macroura]) and Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii); grazing did not affect occupancy of these species. In eastern Kansas, species diversity was highest in grazed, unburned fields. In western Kansas, bird communities in grazed and ungrazed fields were dissimilar, as determined from multivariate analysis. Though regionally variable, conservative stocking of cattle on CRP grasslands during the nesting season as a mid-contract management tool might increase bird species diversity by restructuring habitat that accommodates a greater variety of species and decreasing abundances of species associated with taller, denser stands of vegetation.",46,2,excluded,Not empirical

In wild birds, artificial illumination alters many natural behaviors that are important for fitness, including chick provisioning. Although incubation is a key determinant of the early developmental environment, studies into the effects of ALAN on bird incubation behavior are lacking. We measured nest temperature in nest boxes of great tits during the incubation period in two consecutive years. Nest boxes were located in eight previously dark field sites that have been experimentally illuminated since 2012 with white, green, or red light, or were left dark. We tested if light treatment affected mean nest temperature, number of times birds leave the nest (off-bout frequency), and off-bout duration during the incubation period. Subsequently, we investigated if incubation behavior is related to fitness. We found that birds incubating in the white light during a cold, early spring had lower mean nest temperatures at the end of incubation, both during the day and during the night, compared to birds in the green light. Moreover, birds incubating in white light took fewer off-bouts, but off-bouts were on average longer. The opposite was true for birds breeding in the green light. Low incubation temperatures and few but long off-bouts can have severe consequences for developing embryos. In our study, eggs from birds that took on average few off-bouts needed more incubation days to hatch compared to eggs from birds that took many off-bouts. Nevertheless, we found no clear fitness effects of light treatment or incubation behavior on the number of hatchlings or hatchling weight. Our results add to the growing body of literature that shows that effects of ALAN can be subtle, can differ due to the spectral composition of light, and can be year-dependent. These subtle alterations of natural behaviors might not have severe fitness consequences in the short-term. However, in the long term they could add up, negatively affecting parent condition and survival as well as offspring recruitment, especially in urban environments where more environmental pollutants are present.

However, eggs of ground-nesting species can be exposed when pesticide applications occur during laying or incubation. We simulated environmentally realistic exposure of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) eggs to an herbicide (2,4-D) and a fungicide (tebuconazole) applied to winter cereal crops during the breeding season of most farmland birds. We analyzed the effects on hatching success, offspring survival, and physiology. Exposure by overspray led to greater pesticide accumulation in the eggshell or content than exposure through contact with treated soil (3.1-13.7 times higher, depending on the pesticide and target sample). Egg overspray with tebuconazole significantly increased chick mortality, which was 26% higher than that of controls. 2,4-D caused a similar but a close to significant increase (chick mortality 24% higher than controls). Exposure to either pesticide through contact with treated soils did not affect chick survival but altered some biochemical parameters posthatching. Our experiment shows that egg spraying with pesticides should be considered as a relevant exposure scenario in risk assessment procedures, given its potential to affect the reproductive success of ground-nesting farmland birds.

We assessed whether sublethal application of weathered Deepwater Horizon crude oil to the eggshell surface alters heart rate and metabolic rate in Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryos. We first determined sublethal applications with a dosing experiment. Embryo viability for eggs exposed to 5 Î¼L or more of crude oil decreased significantly. We conducted a second experiment to measure heart rate and metabolic rate (CO2 production) 5 and 9 d after 1 sublethal application of crude oil to eggshells on day 3 of incubation. One application of 1.0 or 2.5 ÂµL of crude oil reduced embryonic heart rate and metabolic rate on day 12 of incubation. Using unfertilized eggs, we measured the transfer of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the eggshell surface to egg contents 9 d after a single application of sublethal crude oil.

However, Chinese tits could reject alien eggs and egg ejection rate increased with the local diversity of parasitic cuckoo species. Antiparasitic behavior among Chinese tits may have evolved due to greater size variation among sympatric cuckoo species. This raises the question of whether differently sized parasitic cuckoos pose different threats to Chinese tits. A green-backed tit Parus monticolus population that is sympatric with Asian emerald cuckoo Chrysococcyx maculatus (eme-cuckoo, small-sized parasite) and common cuckoo Cuculus canorus (com-cuckoo, large-sized parasite), and a cinereous tit P. cinereus population that is only sympatric with com-cuckoo were chosen as study organisms. We observed behavioral response and recorded alarm calls of the 2 tit species to eme-cuckoo, com-cuckoo, chipmunk Tamias sibiricus (a nest predator) and dove Streptopelia orientalis (a harmless control), and subsequently played back alarm calls to conspecific incubating females. In dummy experiments, both tit species performed intense response behavior to chipmunk, but rarely responded strongly to the 3 avian species. In playback experiments, both tit species responded strongly to conspecific chipmunk alarm calls, but rarely responded to dove alarm calls. The intensity of response of incubating female green-backed tits to eme-cuckoo and com-cuckoo alarm calls were similar to that of chipmunk alarm calls, while the intensity to eme-cuckoo alarm calls was higher than the intensity to dove alarm calls which was similar to that of com-cuckoo alarm calls.

We compare the impact of biocontrol, provided by bats and birds, with that of crop raiding by vervet monkeys on yield in South African macadamia orchards. Insectivorous bats and birds are known to feed on macadamia pest insect species, like the macadamia nut borer or the green vegetable bug. Vervet monkeys move into the orchards during the day to feed on premature macadamia nuts. Bats, birds and monkeys benefit from patches of natural vegetation adjacent to orchards. With exclusion experiments (four treatments: day, night, day and night, control) we quantified the relative importance of biocontrol and crop raiding on yield, comparing two different landscape settings of the orchards, a natural and a human-modified. Crop raiding occurred only close to natural vegetation and caused yield losses of about 26%. Biocontrol by bats and birds was higher near natural vegetation, but still significant in human-modified landscapes, at up to 530Â m distance to forest patches. Prevented biocontrol through the exclusion of bats and birds resulted in yield losses of up to 60%. Effects of biocontrol by bats and birds (USD ~5,000Â ha/year) were economically more important than the losses of crop raiding (USD ~1,600Â ha/year). As both are linked to the vicinity of forest patches, the removal of natural vegetation to limit monkey abundances would also limit biocontrol service provision. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the high economic benefits of biocontrol by bats and birds, which outweighed negative impacts through yield losses caused by crop raiding monkeys. Management practices to prevent crop damage, such as guarding, excluding vertebrates or removal of adjacent natural vegetation, would also limit access for bats and birds and the great economic benefits provided by their biocontrol. Ecosystem services by bats and birds can be promoted by the exposure of artificial roost and nest sites, but research into species-specific preferences is needed. The education of farmers is crucial, as many are unaware of the benefits from birds and bats and the fact that these benefits can outweigh the disadvantages of the monkeysâ€™ crop raiding.

Therefore, egg retrieval is an ancient, and likely ancestral, widespread behaviour in birds. However, it has received little attention in studies of avian brood parasitism, perhaps because most parasitism occurs in species with complex nests, a context in which egg retrieval seems irrelevant. However, for cavity-nesting hosts of avian brood parasites, egg retrieval may still play an important role in the coevolutionary interactions between obligate brood parasites and hosts, because egg retrieval can be considered to be antagonistic to egg rejection behaviour in hosts, yet both may involve cognition to recognize eggs. We hypothesized that (1) cavity-nesting hosts should retrieve misplaced eggs from outside the nest cup, (2) brood parasitism has modulated egg retrieval behaviour in cavity-nesting hosts and (3) hosts use the same visual cues for decision-making during egg recognition in both egg retrieval and egg rejection actions. To test these hypotheses, we performed a series of experiments in a cavity-nesting host, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus). Foreign eggs with different levels of mimicry were placed within or outside nest cups of hosts to test their responses. We found that host decisions about whether to retrieve or reject an egg both depended on the degree of mimicry. However, hosts sometimes first retrieved poorly mimetic foreign eggs and then rejected them. Alternatively, hosts sometimes failed to retrieve highly mimetic conspecific eggs. We suggest that egg retrieval in hosts is likely to be a result of the interaction between ancient retrieval behaviour and subsequent adaptation against brood parasitism.

Widespread, long-term population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have elicited concern about negative effects of livestock grazing on sage-grouse populations. Hypothesized relationships, mostly untested, between livestock and sage-grouse nesting ecology have played a prominent role in shaping public land livestock grazing policy and broader discussions about management of grazing in sagebrush ecosystems. We tested predictions arising from several commonly hypothesized mechanisms by which livestock may affect nesting habitat quality for sage-grouse in a grazed landscape in central Montana, USA. We employed Bayesian variable selection methods to identify factors related to both nest site selection and nest success, focusing on indices of livestock use at local and pasture scales and including other factors known to influence nesting ecology such as anthropogenic features and weather. In spite of some evidence nest survival was positively associated with senesced vegetation height, evidence for effects of livestock presence and indices of local livestock use on nest site selection and survival was equivocal at best. In contrast, we found strong evidence that females selected nest sites based on relatively static features such as sagebrush cover and distance from gravel and paved roads, whereas nest failure was driven primarily by extended periods of heavy precipitation. Management of sage-grouse nesting habitat in this region should focus on conserving areas of adequate shrub cover and preventing further fragmentation by roads. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

A greater understanding of these traits, particularly those that are unique to females, may shed light on the potential for sexual selection to shape female phenotypes. Recently, blue-green eggshell colour, derived from the antioxidant pigment biliverdin, has been proposed as a candidate trait that advertises female quality to males in species of birds with biparental care. However, studies have been equivocal in their support for blue-green eggshell colour being an informative signal, and correlations between eggshell colour and other female characteristics have been inconsistent. We conducted a supplementation experiment to test if improving the access of female birds to food resources and micronutrients, thereby improving their condition prior to egg laying, would intensify the blue-green colouration of the eggs they laid. We provided mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides with food and carotenoids during nest building and egg laying in two breeding seasons, and assessed both within- and among-clutch variation in colour. Supplementation did not affect patterns of within-clutch variation, but did result in differences in colour among clutches. Specifically, we found that food, but not carotenoids, resulted in higher colour saturation, and decreased the brightness of blue-green eggshells. Although this trend was observed in both years, the effect was statistically significant only in one year. Our results suggest that food supplementation influences eggshell colour, but that conditions, such as weather and natural food availability, which can vary annually, may also determine how female birds allocate pigment to eggshells.",65,2,excluded,no green nest material

Previous studies have suggested that insectivorous birds can detect the HIPVs for prey location. The production of HIPVs is partly mediated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate is one compound involved in the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Therefore, spraying of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) solution on plants can induce the emission of volatiles similar to the HIPVs induced by herbivory. We performed two field experiments to test whether insectivorous adult birds are attracted to Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) treated with MeJa solutions. We used artificial larvae to measure bird predation rate. There were no differences in the predation rates of plasticine larvae between control and MeJa treatments, suggesting that insectivorous birds were not attracted to trees treated with MeJa. We also tested whether blue tit nestlings without previous experience in foraging respond to the scent of Pyrenean oak tree leaves treated with MeJa, to test whether the attraction to MeJa-treated trees is innate. A similar number of nestlings performed begging responses when exposed to the scent of leaves of MeJa-treated trees compared to the scent of leaves of control untreated trees. Furthermore, the duration of the first begging was similar in response to the volatiles emitted by MeJa-treated trees and untreated trees. Despite previous evidence suggesting that insectivorous birds are attracted to HIPVs, our results show that neither insectivorous adult birds nor inexperienced nestlings were attracted to trees treated with MeJa. Further studies are needed to disentangle whether the differences in the emission of volatiles between herbivore-infested trees and MeJa-treated trees can explain this lack of attraction to MeJa-treated Pyrenean oak trees.

This reclamation can provide a novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to 2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis, and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK, between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat) and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e., microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking, prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites. On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age. Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g., nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing bobwhite.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of eggshell coloration. In this experimental study, we tested two hypotheses (signalling-function hypothesis and structural-function hypothesis) on both eggshell pigment types in an open-nesting songbird, the canary (Serinus canaria). Also, we aimed to examine whether deposition of pigments into the eggshell has any cost in terms of the plasma oxidative status of the female. We found that eggshell average blue-green chroma was increased by antioxidant supplementation, although we note that there had already been a pre-existing bias in plasma antioxidant capacity between the supplemented and control groups. Eggshell average blue-green chroma was positively related to female body condition during egg laying. However, blue-green eggshell colour was not related to female oxidative status during or after the laying period, and blue-green chroma increased with laying order. Accordingly, we found some support for that eggshell blue-green colour could reflect maternal antioxidant availability and body condition, but did not find evidence that it has a cost for the femaleâ€™s oxidative status. By contrast, eggshell spot brightness was positively related to body condition, suggesting that darker spotting reflected poorer nutritional condition in the canary. Eggshell blue-green pigmentation was not significantly connected to the egg volume or yolk antioxidant level, but we found that eggs with lower yolk antioxidant concentration had higher average eggshell brown chroma. In sum, our results suggest that eggshell colour reflected female antioxidant and nutrient availability. Finally, we found that eggs with thinner eggshells had a more aggregated spot distribution, supporting the view that aggregated spots may help to strengthen eggshells. Significance statement: Avian eggs have a large variability in colours and patterns, which are due to two pigments: the blue-green biliverdin and the red-brown protoporphyrin. In this study, we tested whether eggshell pigmentation, measured by a spectrophotometer, could reflect female and egg quality in the canary, an open nesting songbird. We found that females supplemented with antioxidants before and during egg-laying laid more intense blue-green eggs. Females in better body condition laid eggs that had a more intense blue-green coloration, but lower intensity of brown coloration. Egg yolk antioxidant level was lower in eggs with more intense brown eggshell coloration. These results suggest that eggshell coloration could reflect the antioxidant and nutrient availability of females. Moreover, we found that eggs with thinner eggshells had a more aggregated spot distribution on the eggshell, supporting the view that aggregated brown pigment spots may help to strengthen eggshells.

This decline includes passerine populations and one of the mechanisms that may be contributing toward this may be increased nest predation. ground covers are agri-environmental measures whose objective is to halt the loss of biodiversity by creating high-quality habitat patches embedded in a homogeneous landscape by maintaining herbaceous ground cover within crops. however, although such patches are selected by breeding birds, they may also attract predators, and an increased nest density in small habitat patches would thus result in increased predation rates. We have therefore performed nest predation experiments with artificial nests in order to investigate whether the effect of ground cover on nest predation is density dependent. The experiments were carried out during the breeding season in 2014, in two areas of olive groves in southern Spain. We used two nest density levels, both in olive groves with ground cover and in those where the ground was bare. A total of 420 nests were placed, 226 of which (53.81\%) suffered predation. Our results showed that 1) nest predation was density dependent in olive groves with ground cover only with respect to tree nests, while there was no density-dependent predation in bare-ground olive groves of either ground-based or tree nests, and 2) artificial nests placed on the ground were more frequently depredated (65\%) than those placed in trees (29\%), irrespective of either the presence of vegetation cover or nest density. This study suggests that variations in patterns of nest predation are determined by the identity of nest predators and their specific foraging behaviours in different landscapes and habitats. It also underscores the need to implement agri-environmental measures aimed at the conservation of farmland birds.",75,1,excluded,Not birds

However, in most studies the exact amount of light at night individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects, e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of light at night.",76,1,excluded,No green nest material

In the present work, the primers were redesigned and improved to overcome the defects found in the previous primers. A new nested PCR method was developed using the improved primers to amplify 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes from NC10 bacteria. In the new nested PCR method, the qP1mF/1492R and 1051F/qP2R primer sets were used in the first and second rounds, respectively. The PCR products were sequenced, and more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the NC10 phylum were obtained using the new primers compared to the previous primers. The sensitivity of the new nested PCR was tested by the serial dilution method, and the limit of detection was approximately 10(3) copies g(-1) dry sed. for the environmental samples compared to approximately 10(5) copies g(-1) dry sed. by the previous method. Finally, the improved primer, qP1mF, was used in quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of NC10 bacteria, and the results agreed well with the activity of AOM-NIR measured by isotope tracer experiments.

Such exposure can occur in the tailings ponds of the mineable oil sands, which are located in Alberta, Canada, under a major continental flyway for waterfowl. Over the 40 year history of the industry, a few thousand bird deaths have been reported following contact with bitumen on the ponds, but a new monitoring programme demonstrated that many thousands of birds land annually without apparent harm. This new insight creates an urgent need for more information on the sublethal effects on birds from non-bitumen toxicants that occur in the water, including naphthenic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and salts. Ten studies have addressed the effects of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), and none reported acute or substantial adverse health effects. Interpretive caution is warranted, however, because nine of the studies addressed reclaimed wetlands that received OSPW, not OSPW ponds per se, and differences between experimental and reference sites may have been reduced by shared sources of pollution in the surrounding air and water. Two studies examined eggs of birds nesting >100 km from the mine sites. Only one study exposed birds directly and repeatedly to OSPW and found no consistent differences between treated and control birds in blood-based health metrics. If it is true that aged forms of OSPW do not markedly affect the health of birds that land briefly on the ponds, then the extensiveness of current bird-deterrent programmes is unwarranted and could exert negative net environmental effects. More directed research on bird health is urgently needed, partly because birds that land on these ponds subsequently migrate to destinations throughout North America where they are consumed by both humans and wildlife predators.",82,2,excluded,Not empirical

Potential hosts can reduce the cost of parasitism by rejecting foreign eggs from the nest. Observational, comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to identify parasitic eggs (egg-nest contrast hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally test whether egg-nest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two colours: orange and green. Contrary to the egg-nest contrast hypothesis, host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn, experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg rejection rate. Our results demonstrate that egg-nest contrast is a collateral, not a causal factor in egg rejection, and confirm the conclusions of previous studies that hosts can rely on the parasitic egg's appearance itself to recognize the foreign egg in the nest.",83,1,excluded,No green nest material

In laboratory experiments, adsorption of Cr(VI) was sensitive to pH in the range investigated (2-5), with maximum adsorption capacity achieved at pH 2 (3.70 +/- 0.04 mg g(-1), representing 93.2\% removal of Cr). The termite nest was characterized by off-line pyrolysis GC/MS (py-GC/MS), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Pyrolysis of the adsorbent produced a complex mixture of aromatic compounds, including the guaiacyl and syringilic derivatives that are characteristic of lignocellulosic materials. Infrared spectroscopy revealed deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group of the biomass with increasing pH, which was associated with a decrease in the capacity for adsorption of Cr(VI). The EPR g-factor for the termite nest samples varied between 2.0037 and 2.0038, indicating the presence of organic free radicals that were responsible for the redox reaction. A second line with g-factor values of 1.9790, only observed for the samples after contact with Cr(VI) solutions at different pH values, was assigned to Cr(III)-Cr(III) exchange coupled pairs, which explained the capacity of the adsorbent to retain a large portion of the Cr(III) ions produced after reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Fixed-bed column experiments showed that the termite nest had a maximum adsorption capacity of 18.60 mg Cr g(-1), an adsorption efficiency varying between 60.8 and 97.4\%, and a desorption efficiency varying between 54.5 and 91.4\%, for three successive cycles.

For the purpose of the study, batches of fermented rooibos plant material were sampled from each of four quality grades during three production seasons (2009, 2010 and 2011) and a sub-sample of each batch was steam-pasteurized. The phenolic content of each rooibos infusion was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection (DAD). In contrast to previous studies, the complete HPLC-DAD signals were used in the chemometric analysis in order to take into account the entire phenolic profile.

Here we suggest that these relationships and the signal function of eggshell coloration would affect the outcome of coevolution between avian brood parasites and their hosts in at least three different non-exclusive evolutionary pathways. First, by laying blue-green coloured eggs, cuckoo females may exploit possible sensory biases of their hosts, constraining the evolution of parasitic egg recognition, and thus avoid rejection. Second, because of the relatively high costs of laying blue eggs, cuckoo females may be limited in their ability to mimic costly blue-green eggs of their hosts because cuckoo females lay many more eggs than their hosts. Furthermore, costs associated with foreign egg recognition errors would be relatively higher for hosts laying blue eggs. Third, cuckoos may use coloration of host eggs for selecting individuals or specific hosts of appropriate phenotypic quality (i.e. parental abilities). We here explored some predictions emerging from the above scenarios and found partial support for two of them by studying egg coloration of European cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and that of their 25 main hosts, as well as parasitism and rejection rate of hosts. Cuckoo hosts parasitized with more blue, green, and ultraviolet cuckoo eggs, or those laying more blue-green eggs, were more prone to accept experimental parasitism with artificial cuckoo eggs. In addition, coloration of cuckoo eggs is more variable when parasitizing hosts laying bluer-greener eggs, even after controlling for the effect of host egg coloration (i.e. degree of egg matching). Globally, our results are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that host egg traits that are related to phenotypic quality of hosts, such as egg coloration, may have important implications for the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and brood parasites.

Egg recognition in most open-nesting hosts seems to be based entirely on differences in colour. However, hole- and dome-nesting hosts may rely largely on luminance contrasts. Here, we studied egg rejection behaviour in nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos), an open-nesting species that nests in deeply shadowed positions and lays very specific dark olive-green eggs. Although being theoretically suitable as hosts of the cuckoo, nightingales are very rarely parasitized and no cuckoo egg morph mimicking nightingale eggs is known. Thus, we predicted high rejection rate of foreign eggs, but because of the dim nesting environments, luminance contrasts would be an important cue in egg rejection decisions, similar to cavity- or dome-nesting species. We experimentally parasitized nightingale nests with two groups of model egg types: bright eggs and dark eggs. Within each group, one of the egg types was an effective match while the other type was a poor colour match (whitish vs. pale blue and olive-green vs. black).We used a discrimination visual model to quantify host-model egg similarity and compared egg rejection predicted by the model with the observed rejection pattern. Consistent with a scenario of largely luminance-based egg recognition, blue and white eggs, which had larger achromatic mismatching, were rejected at a higher relative rate than the better achromatic matching black and green eggs. Nightingales showed strong aggression to a cuckoo dummy, suggesting that they were involved in coevolutionary interactions with the cuckoo in the past. However, because of the highly distinct appearance of nightingale eggs relative to the other sympatrically breeding passerines, and the largely luminance-based egg recognition, this arms race was likely terminated at an early stage.",107,2,excluded,No green nest material

Habitat variables, including height above ground, vegetation level, vegetation density at locations where these three types of behavior occurred, and structure, height and diameter at breast height (dbh) of the plant used were recorded from March to July of 2002. The Gray-checked Fulvetta predominantly nested in bushes and among herbs (86.7\%), but usually foraged and sang in trees (70.8\% and 78.3\%, respectively). Consequently, significant differences were found in the structure of plants and vegetation level used among nesting, foraging, and singing behavior. Gray-checked Fulvettas built their nests at an average height of 1.05 m; however, they foraged around 3.75 m and sang at 5.30 m above ground. On the other hand, nests were situated within the most concealed area, with an average vegetation density of 74\%, significantly greater than those of the foraging and singing sites (45\%, 38\%, respectively). The differential use of microhabitat among these three types of behavior strongly exhibits the divergent adaptation of different behaviors to a bird's environment.

This is crucial for longlived species, where increased parental effort in current reproduction profoundly affects future reproduction. Indication of reproductive value or willingness to invest in reproduction may promote matching responses by mates, thus reducing the conflict over care. In birds with biparental care, blue-green eggshell color may function as a signal of reproductive value that affects parental effort, as predicted by the signaling hypothesis of blue-green eggshell coloration. However, this hypothesis has not been explored during incubation, when the potential stimulus of egg color is present, and has been little studied in longlived birds. We experimentally studied if egg color affected incubation patterns in the blue-footed booby, a longlived species with biparental care and blue eggs. We exchanged fresh eggs between nests of the same laying date and recorded parental incubation effort on the following 4 days. Although egg color did not affect male effort, original eggshell color was correlated with pair matching in incubation. Exchanged eggshell color did not affect incubation patterns. This suggests that biliverdin-based egg coloration reflects female quality features that are associated with pair incubation effort or that blue-footed boobies mate assortatively high-quality pairs incubating more colorful clutches. An intriguing possibility is that egg coloration facilitates an equal sharing of incubation, the signal being functional only during a short period close to laying. Results also suggest that indication of reproductive value reduces the conflict over care. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",119,2,excluded,No green nest material

Few studies have explored nest building and maintenance from this perspective, although the nest is the first environment experienced by hatchlings. On Corsica, blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, incorporate fresh fragments of several species of aromatic plants in the nest cup throughout the nesting period, and replenish the nest with fresh fragments of the same plant species quickly after experimental removal. In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants used by blue tits affect the growth and condition of nestlings. Because we expected the effects of plants to depend on environmental conditions, we tested this hypothesis both in enlarged and in control broods. Aromatic plants positively affected chick mass gain in enlarged broods. Chicks in nests containing aromatic plants also had higher haematocrit levels. In addition, in 1 of the 2 study years, feathers developed faster in aromatic-treated nests than in nests where aromatic plants had been replaced by a neutral nest material (moss). However, no significant effect of aromatic plants on chick body size at. edging was found.

Following establishment, increased resource availability may also facilitate the spread of exotic plant species if it enhances their competitive abilities relative to native species. Exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) introduce both exotic grass seed and nutrients to an endangered plant community on the Gulf Islands of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. I used greenhouse experiments to assess the competitive advantage of the exotic grasses relative to native and exotic forbs in this community and to test the impacts of nutrient addition from goose feces on competitive outcomes. I grew experimental communities varying in their proportion of forbs versus exotic grasses, and added goose feces as a nutrient source. I found that both native and exotic forbs produced significantly more biomass in competition with conspecifics than in competition with the grasses, and that the proportional abundance of two out of three native forbs was lowest in the combined presence of exotic grasses and nutrient addition. In a second experiment, I found that in monoculture all species of forbs and grasses showed equal growth responses to nutrients. The exotic species did not convert additional nutrients into additional biomass at a higher rate, but did germinate earlier and grow larger than the native species regardless of nutrient availability. This suggests that the exotic species may have achieved their competitive advantage partly by pre-empting resources in community mixtures. Small and late-germinating native forbs may be particularly vulnerable to competitive suppression from exotic grasses and forbs and may be at an even greater disadvantage if their competitors are benefiting from early access to additional nutrients. In combination, the input of exotic propagules and additional nutrients by nesting geese may compromise efforts to maintain native community composition in this system.

In natural populations, Corsican blue tit chicks are exposed to the highest levels of blood-sucking ectoparasitic blow flies Protocalliphora spp. reported in Europe. These ectoparasites can have severe negative effects on chick development and survival probabilities, especially when food constraints are elevated. Here we investigated in several natural Corsican blue tit populations the hypothesis that aromatic plants brought to the nest have anti-blow fly effects during the chick-rearing stage. We predicted that: 1) the amount of aromatic plants should be negatively related to blow fly infestation intensity across nests, 2) experimental addition of aromatic plants in nests should reduce blow fly infestation intensity, and 3) nestlings should be in better physical condition in nests where aromatic plants were experimentally added. No significant relation was found between amount of aromatic plants in nests and blow fly infestation intensity. Experimental addition of aromatic plants did not reduce blow fly infestation intensity and did not affect the chick phenotypic parameters we measured.

Many birds and a few mammals also incorporate green plant material into their nests. Collecting plant material rich in volatile compounds might be an efficient way to fight bacteria and fungi. However, no study has demonstrated that this behaviour has a positive effect on survival. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that animals using plant compounds with antibacterial and antifungal properties survive better when exposed to detrimental micro-organisms. The presence of resin strongly improves the survival of F. paralugubris adults and larvae exposed to the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, and the survival of larvae exposed to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae.

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.",134,2,excluded,no green nest material

The most frequently studied selective forces moulding egg colouration-predation and brood parasitism-have either received little empirical support or may play a role in only a minority of species. A novel hypothesis has suggested that egg colour may be significantly influenced by sexual selection. Females may deposit a blue-green pigment biliverdin into eggshells instead of using it for themselves as a powerful antioxidant. By this handicap, females may signal their quality to males, which are then hypothesized to increase their paternal effort. We experimentally tested the hypothesis in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a species laying blue-green eggs. We cross-fostered clutches between nests to disentangle effects of female/territory quality and egg colour on paternal effort and nestling quality. The results supported two assumptions of sexual signalling through egg colour hypothesis: Blue pigment seems to be a limited resource for females, and female quality is positively correlated with the intensity of the blue-green colour. However, we did not find support for the main prediction of the hypothesis, as male parental effort parameters (feeding frequencies to nestlings and intensity of nest defence) were unrelated to egg colour. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and previous correlative analyses that supported the hypothesis that blue egg colour may be a postmating, sexually selected signal in females.

Little is known regarding sage-grouse response to various sagebrush management techniques.

Greater sage-grouse brood use was higher in Tebuthiuron than control plots (P = 0.01). We believe this was attributed to increased herbaceous cover, particularly forb cover. However, in all plots, sage-grouse use was greatest within 10 m of the edge of the treatments where adjacent sagebrush cover was still available. Although the treatments we studied resulted in the plots achieving sage-grouse brooding-rearing habitat guidelines, caution should be exercised in applying these observations at lower elevations, on sites with less annual precipitation, or on a different subspecies of big sagebrush. Prior to using these techniques to implement large-scale sagebrush treatments, the specific rationale for conducting them should be clearly identified.

More variable clutches show higher peak chroma values. We also show that egg colour during the two-week incubation period has a significant effect, which is not found for the colour of eggs during the laying period.

By experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in the nests, to give the appearance that highly attractive males defended them, we induced females to increase their feather carrying rates. 4. The amount of feathers carried to the nest was correlated to female reproductive experience and laying date, two variables correlated with female body condition.

I tested this hypothesis with tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor (Vieillot, 1808), a species that has large infestations of ectoparasites in its nests. I experimentally added green leaves of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) to nests and compared these nests to control nests. My results showed that nests with yarrow had significantly higher levels of infestation by fleas, and yarrow had no effect on the number of blow flies detected. There was no effect of yarrow on condition of parents, size of offspring, or the probability of nests fledging at least one young. I did, however, find that second-year (SY) females with yarrow added to their nests hatched significantly more eggs than control SY females. In addition, pairs with yarrow added to their nest were significantly less likely to suffer hatching failure and (or) brood reduction. These beneficial effects of yarrow cannot be explained by reductions in numbers of fleas or blow flies, and I suggest that these results may be due to reductions in numbers of other types of parasites not quantified in my study, such as flying insects or the diseases that they may vector.

We simultaneously tested these three hypotheses in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, in the field. Green material was carried by male starlings only, and mainly during nest building. It was not used to reduce ectoparasites. Males nesting in nestboxes that were experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more green nest material than males nesting in control boxes, and experimental removal and addition of green material had no effect on the number of ectoparasites on the nestlings or on their body mass. Furthermore, the amount of green material carried into a nestbox was not associated with male body mass, paternal incubation attendance or nestling food provisioning. There is two-fold experimental evidence that males use green plant material to attract mates. First, removal of greenery resulted in a significantly lower percentage of nestboxes containing a clutch than the control or addition treatment. Second, unpaired male starlings sang more and carried more greenery into a nestbox when a caged female was positioned adjacent to the nestbox than when a caged male or an empty cage was present.

We tested this prediction in monogamous pairs of facultatively polygynous European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris).

Reduced paternal incubation resulted in lower overall incubation (the female did not compensate) and lower hatching success. Immediately after experimental reduction of clutches, males spent significantly less time incubating and more time singing and carrying greenery, and vice versa for experimentally enlarged clutches. Males with experimentally reduced clutches attracted a second female more often than males with experimentally enlarged clutches. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide experimental evidence for an adjustment of paternal care and male mate-attraction effort to clutch size.

Although above- and belowground biota can both cause such mosaics, few studies have addressed their interacting effects. We studied multi-trophic interactions between aboveground vertebrate grazers, subterranean ants, plant-pathogenic soil biota (especially nematodes) and the vegetation in a temperate grassland. We found that when rabbits and cattle locally omit vegetation patches, yellow ants (Lasius flavus) respond to the taller vegetation by digging up more sand from deeper soil layers (hence making taller nest mounds), probably to maintain sufficiently high soil temperatures. We found that this ant digging affects other soil biota, as the mounds contain fewer plant-parasitic and fungivore nematodes. Also, the mounds have lower moisture content and soil bulk densities, and higher pH and available nutrient content than the directly surrounding soil. The clonal sedge Carex arenaria grows Vigorously on the mounds, producing more shoots and shorter rhizome internode lengths than in surrounding vegetation. Other plant species, such as the grass Festuca rubra, dominate the surrounding vegetation.

Rhizome biomass and shoot production of C. arenaria were indeed inhibited less by biota in soil from ant mounds than by biota in soil from the surrounding vegetation. However, the total biomass production of C. arenaria was inhibited as strongly in both soil types. F. rubra was inhibited more strongly by biota in the surrounding soil. We suggest that various direct and indirect interactions between above- and belowground biota can contribute to community mosaics and hence diversity in grasslands.",168,2,excluded,Not birds

The natural living-space of wildlife is shrinking due to human activities. 70\% of the hunting areas are cultivated today. The majority of wild animals is squeezed into the plough-lands, where they are threatened not only by harvesters and mowers, but also by the adverse effects of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. The experiment was aimed at modelling the effects of NIKROL - UAN solution on chick embryos. In alfalfa-fields different solutions of NIKROL are used for manuring: concentrated solution for basic fertilization, 50\% solution for mulching and 20\% solution for foliar fertilization. The time of foliar fertilization coincides with the egg-laying and hatching period of pheasants and partridges, thus endangering the reproductive success of these species. In the experiment the effects of different NIKROL - UAN solutions (concentrated, 50\%, 20\%, 1\%) on embryonic development were determined. Main results: Concentrated, 50\% and 20\% solutions of NIKROL injected into the eggs caused 87-96\% embryonic mortality right after treatment. Embryomortality slightly decreased (27-80\%) when eggs were immersed in the solutions, but still was dose-dependent. 29 different morphological deformities were detected of which the most frequent ones were stunted growth (16\%) and cyst over the embryo (14\%). Statistical analysis showed that in the second 5 days of incubation NICROL did not influence the weight gain of living embryos when eggs were immersed in the solutions. NIKROL - UAN solution proved to be dangerous to small games nestling in alfalfa- and winter-cereal fields. This fact calls for the extention of research on the postembryonic development of birds, and other animal species (deer, rabbit, etc.). Neglecting fertilization is inconceivable these days, bur the application of fertilizers should be carried out with circumspection. In order to protect birds foliar fertilization should be completed at a time not coinciding with the egg-laying and hatching period. The protection of other animal species accounts for the reduction of the amount of fertilizer applied. Nowadays there are numerous biological methods for nutrient supply and yield-increase (green manure, compost, bacterial inoculation of soil, etc.).",170,1,excluded,no green nest material

We compared their relative acceptability to wild, adult pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by offering live A. cardamines and P. napi together with two non-aposematic butterflies on the tray attached to birds' nesting boxes. Experienced predators equally attacked white and non-white butterflies, and the order of attack among the Pieridae was random. If anything, there was a slight indication that the female A. cardamines was the least favoured prey. Since birds did not avoid white coloration, we compared the palatability of these two species against known palatable and unpalatable butterflies by presenting them to great tits (Parus major). Pieris brassicae, which has been earlier described as unpalatable, was also included in the palatability test. However, there were no significant differences in the palatability of the butterflies to birds, and even P. brassicae was apparently palatable to the great tits. Our results do not unambiguously support the hypothesis that the white coloration of Pieridae would signal unpalatability. Nevertheless, in our last experiment, pied flycatchers often rejected or left untouched free flying P. napi and A. cardamines. This suggests that other features in a more natural situation, such as the agile flight pattern or odours might still make them unprofitable to birds.",171,2,excluded,Not birds

Protonation and deprotonation reactions at these sites promote the trapping of electrons and holes, thereby inhibiting further migration. The extent of migration determines the final distribution of damage in irradiated DNA. In this study, electron and hole migration is investigated in a crystalline DNA hexamer intercalated with an anthracycline drug. The intercalator is no further than 2 base pairs away from any DNA base. From EPR measurements, there is no evidence of DNA-centered radicals in the irradiated DNA hexamer. The aromatic region of the anthracycline intercalator evidently sequesters most or all of the electrons and most of the holes. Further hole trapping and radical stabilization appear to occur on the anthracycline's amino sugar group, which is nestled in the minor groove of the hexamer. The relatively large yield of this proposed amino sugar radical suggests that holes generated in the DNA solvation shell migrate to the amino sugar, where they become trapped. This would be the first observation of a radical formed by the direct effect of low-dose, low-LET radiation that is trapped within the DNA helix, yet lies outside of the stacked bases. With respect to holes generated in the DNA bases at 4 K, we conclude that most, if not all, are capable of migrating to an intercalator less than or equal to 2 base pairs away. With respect to dry electrons, we conclude that anthracycline competes effectively for electron trapping over a region of at least 2 base pairs; our experiments cannot distinguish between electron attachment to the bases followed by transfer to the intercalator and direct attachment to the intercalator.

In such cages the quail hens show symptoms of pre-laying restlessness, The inability to perform normal pre-laying behaviour is regarded as one of the most important problems for the welfare of caged laying hens. The present study aimed at identifying key nest site stimuli for quails, to enable nest boxes to be designed for alternative housing systems. Groups of hens were kept in pens containing litter, nest boxes and dustbathing boxes. The type of nest box was varied between pens, and the incidence of eggs laid outside the nest boxes (floor-eggs) was recorded over periods of 15 days. In experiment 1 (8 groups of 30 hens), both the nature of the top of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) and the type of substrate in the nest boxes (artificial turf or hay) had a significant effect on the percentage of floor-eggs. Nest boxes with a top with slits and filled with hay were best accepted for laying. Nest boxes situated in the corners of the pens were significantly selected more often for egg laying than more central nests. In experiment 2 (8 groups of 14 hens), neither the nature of the sides of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) nor the colour of the nest boxes (green or brown) had a significant effect on the incidence of floor-eggs. In experiment 3 (16 groups of 14 hens with 2 or 3 cocks), the percentage of floor-eggs was significantly lower in pens with high (170 lux) than with low (15 lux) light intensity. There was also a tendency for nest boxes filled with chaff to be better accepted than nest boxes filled with hay. In experiments 2 and 3, in pens with floors half litter and half of perforated plastic more floor-eggs were found on the litter. Few eggs were laid in the dustbathing boxes in any experiment. This study shows that Japanese quail lay up to 90\% of eggs in nest boxes provided these are properly designed. It should therefore be feasible to develop housing systems with nests for Japanese quail which may replace conventional battery cages.

Nestboxes with eggs were installed and their fate was followed for 72 h to determine whether egg destruction and nest site take-overs occurred as predicted by the Egg Protection and Limited Breeding Opportunities Hypotheses, or whether additional eggs appeared in the boxes as predicted by the Brood Parasitism Hypothesis. Eggs were destroyed at 40.6\% of 69 experimental boxes but at only 4.5\% of control nests occupied by laying pairs. No eggs were laid in the experimental boxes. Egg destruction at experimental nests occurred during daylight hours and all mortality was caused by green-rumped parrotlets. Over 75\% of the nests were destroyed by male-female pairs prospecting for nest sites, and the remainder were destroyed by male-male pairs. Lone males never destroyed eggs, although they frequently visited experimental boxes. Two of three failures at control nests were the result of nocturnal predators, and the other nest was apparently destroyed by parrotlets. There was no significant difference between experimental and control boxes in the frequency of visitations by lone males, male-female pairs and male-male pairs. Although experimental boxes that parrotlets visited were discovered quickly after placement, parrotlets were usually slow to enter them ((X) over bar = 5.8 h after discovery, range 0.3-23.5 h). Control nests were rarely left unattended: females spent nearly 75\% of their time in the box, and pairs were typically absent for short intervals (median=7.5 min). Control females responded to intruding parrotlets by remaining in the box 94\% of the time when alone, whereas males actively displaced and chased intruding parrotlets 66\% of the time. Parrotlets that visited control nests approached the box significantly less often than those visiting experimental boxes. To ensure the survival of eggs, parrotlet parents must begin incubating eggs or guarding nests soon after laying to minimize destruction of clutches, loss of nest sites, a decline in the viability of their eggs and the time that all nestlings are exposed to predators.

Recent evidence suggests that birds use secondary chemicals contained in green plants to control ectoparasites.  We manipulated green nesting material and ectoparasites of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to test two hypotheses:  (1) ectoparasites adversely affect prefledging survival and morphometrics or postfledging survival, and (2) green nesting material ameliorates the effects of ectoparasites.  We recorded fat score, numbers of scabs, tarsal length, body mass, and hematocrit level on each nestling 17 days after hatching.  We also fitted each nestling with unique patagial tags and resighted the starlings for 6-8 weeks after fledging to estimate survival and sighting rates.  Nests devoid of green nesting material and dusted with the insecticide, carbaryl, had fewer high ectoparasite infestations, and nestlings had significantly lower scab scores, and significantly higher body masses than nestlings in undusted boxes.  However, there was no difference in postfledging survival between birds from carbaryl-treated and undusted nests.  There also was no difference in prefledging survival and morphometrics or postfledging survival between nestlings from boxes with and without green nesting material.

Hedgerows and meadows were found around all of the nests and most of them were supported by hedgerows, so bullfinches consistently used the general woody vegetation available as reproduction habitat and site. Also, poplar plantations appeared preferentially in the immediate surroundings of the nests. Partly reflecting these results, bullfinches chose zones with greater shrub and tree cover than that available. Bullfinches placed their nests on a wide variety of plant species, but showed predilection for thorny species. Overall mean height of nests above the ground was 1.43 m and large-sized shrubs/trees were preferred. The most predominant bullfinch nest orientations were S, E and centered, which arguably provided thermal benefits and protected from severe weather. In general, there were no significant temporal variations in nest-site selection. With the exception of thorny support and favourable orientation, acting jointly, there was no significant association between nest-site characteristics and nesting success, presumably because many nests were already located in the most advantageous places at each time, and because despite this, predation pressure was high. Nest external dimensions were relatively variable, whereas internal width was the least variable nest dimension. No significant monthly or interannual variations in nest weight were observed. Larger nests did not hold larger clutches. Successful nests were larger than unsuccessful ones. The bullfinch nests were of simple construction, with two clearly different regions, the outer nest and the internal cup, with no significant temporal variations in the weight of either. The outer, structural nest consisted mainly of twigs, whereas roots and herbaceous shoots were the highest fractions lining the cup. Hair was the only animal-derived material used by bullfinches.

These vaPS cells fundamentally differ from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells in that the latter possess the necessary genetic guidance that makes them intrinsically pluripotent. In contrast, vaPS cells do not have this intrinsic genetic guidance, but are able to differentiate into somatic cells of all three lineages under guidance of the microenvironment they are located in, independent from the original tissue or organ where they had resided. These vaPS cells are of high relevance for clinical application because they are contained in unmodified, autologous, adipose-derived regenerative cells (UA-ADRCs). The latter can be obtained from and re-applied to the same patient at the point of care, without the need for further processing, manipulation, and culturing.

In this study, BMSCs were derived from the bone marrow of male Wistar rats (4 weeks old) through density gradient centrifugation (1.073 g/mL), and the cell purity of BMSCs was up to 95%. The combined injection of basic fibroblast growth factor and edaravone was conducted to differentiate BMSCs into neuron-like cells. In this study, 120 male Wistar rats were used to establish the model of semitransverse SCI; on the seventh day, neuron-like cells were labeled by BrdU and then injected into the epicenter of the injury of rats. On the 14th day after cell transplantation, the biotin dextran amine (BDA) fluorescent agent was used to track the repair of nerve damage. At 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after SCI, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale method was used to measure the functional recovery of hind limbs in rats. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blotting, and Real-time quantitative reverse transcripion PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to observe the regeneration of nerve cells. In the edaravone+BMSC group, behavioral analysis of locomotor function showed that functional recovery was significantly enhanced after transplantation of the cells, BrdU-positive cells could be observed scattered in the injured area and extended to both the head and tail, and the BDA tracer shows that the edaravone+BMSC group emits more fluorescent signals. Additionally, H&E staining, Nissl staining, and immunohistochemistry revealed that the space of spinal cord tissue was attenuated and the neurons were increased. Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Nestin, and neurofilament 200 (NF) were increased, while the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was decreased. TEM showed that cytoplasmic edema was reduced, mitochondrial vacuoles were attenuated, and nuclear chromatin concentration was declined after transplantation of neuron-like cells. Moreover, with the extension of time of edaravone+BMSC transplantation, the structures of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum tended to be normal. In summary, the induced differentiation of BMSC transplantation can significantly promote the functional repair of SCI.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic injury resulting in loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function distal from the level of injury. An appropriate combination of biomaterials and bioactive substances is currently thought to be a promising approach to treat this condition. Systemic administration of valproic acid (VPA) has been previously shown to promote functional recovery in animal models of SCI. In this study, VPA was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microfibers by the coaxial electrospinning technique. Fibers showed continuous and cylindrical morphology, randomly oriented fibers, and compatible morphological and mechanical characteristics for application in SCI. Drug-release analysis indicated a rapid release of VPA during the first day of the in vitro test. The coaxial fibers containing VPA supported adhesion, viability, and proliferation of PC12 cells. In addition, the VPA/PLGA microfibers induced the reduction of PC12 cell viability, as has already been described in the literature. The biomaterials were implanted in rats after SCI. The groups that received the implants did not show increased functional recovery or tissue regeneration compared to the control. These results indicated the cytocompatibility of the VPA/PLGA core-shell microfibers and that it may be a promising approach to treat SCI when combined with other strategies.

These â€˜trophic cascadesâ€™ can be seriously disrupted by the local extinction of top predators. They can also be restored by the subsequent re-introduction of top predators by conservationists. Here, we investigated trophic cascades involving kÄ�kÄ�, puriri moths and their host trees. New Zealand kÄ�kÄ� (Nestor meridionalis, Nestoridae) are large parrots that were extirpated from most of its range in the 20th century. Unlike most other parrots, kÄ�kÄ� forage primarily by digging through the vascular cambium of trees in search of wood-boring insects. They regularly consume puriri moths (Aenetus virescens, Hepialidae), a giant species of ghost moth whose larvae tunnel into the heartwood of trees for protection. Puriri moths are host specific and frequently attack makomako (Aristotelia serrata, Elaeocarpaceae), a sub-canopy tree species. We conducted a field experiment in Zealandia, a nature reserve to which kÄ�kÄ� were reintroduced over a decade ago, to test the hypothesis that kÄ�kÄ� would increase tree fitness by removing larval parasites (i.e. herbivores). Contrary to our expectations, results revealed an additive, negative effect of both the predator (kÄ�kÄ�) and parasite (puriri moths) on plant fitness. Therefore, the tri-trophic interactions restored by the reintroduction of kÄ�kÄ� into Zealandia appear to be unique, as the actions of the predator decreased fruit and flower production, rather than increasing plant fitness, as typically reported for trophic cascades.

This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of â€œnon-plantâ€� indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests over ground. To detect ecological responses that occur for the first year since a herbaceous community has been exposed to potentially bioactive RF-EMF, the first two indicators groups should be used.

Both natural fluctuations in environmental conditions and habitat management measures can temporarily cause adverse environmental effects. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the invasive parasitic fly Philornis downsi, control of invasive plants and precipitation on the breeding success of Darwin's finches. Introduced plant species have invaded a unique forest on the Galapagos island of Santa Cruz, which is a key habitat for Darwin's finches. The Galapagos National Park Directorate applies manual control and herbicides to combat this invasion. We hypothesized that these measures led to a reduction in the arthropod food supply during chick rearing, which in turn caused mortality in chicks that were already weakened by parasitism. We compared food availability in three study sites of varying degrees of weed management. To assess the interaction of parasitism and weed management, we experimentally reduced P. downsi abundance in nests in all three study sites. The key result suggests that there is an increase in the adverse effect of parasitism under unfavourable habitat conditions. As predicted, we found a negative additive effect of parasitism and weed management on the breeding success of the insectivorous warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea), but not on the omnivorous small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus), which was strongly affected by parasitism independently of weed management. Management measures can temporarily decrease environmental quality and reduce resistance/tolerance to invasive species. This should be considered when applying management measures to habitats of vulnerable species. Â© 2019 The Authors",209,1,excluded,no green nest material

Phytoplasma colonization in the host plant has been shown to depend on the affecting phytoplasma group and the properties of the host plant. Such studies on phytoplasma colonization are scanty in the agriculturally important annuals that are suffering severe yield losses worldwide. In this regard, the oilseed crop â€˜sesameâ€™ which is a common annual host of phytoplasma and generally shows symptoms of phyllody on infection, was selected for the study. Vegetative tissues were collected from progressive stages of sesame phyllody from pre/post-blooming infection. Phytoplasma was initially detected using nested-PCR and transmission electron microscopy. A TaqMan based qPCR assay was then performed to detect and understand the in planta distribution of phytoplasma in sesame under field conditions. Results revealed a wide range of phytoplasma titer across the organs of phyllody affected sesame plants i.e. 22 cells to 4.2 Ã— 107 cells/Î¼g plant DNA. The lowest titer was observed in the roots, whereas the maximum number of phytoplasma cells was observed in the leaves. Phytoplasma concentration positively correlated with disease severity during the initial three stages of disease progression; however, a decline was observed at a later stage. In addition, significant variation was observed in the upper and lower plant parts,and the pattern showed a reversal with respect to early and late stages of disease. The study indicates that the lower plant parts of sesame are advantageous for phytoplasma detection at early stages. However, for experiments with pre-requisite of high phytoplasma abundance, leaves from later stages of phyllody will be beneficial. The outcomes will prove useful in effective sampling of sesame tissues for research and quarantine purposes. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of the in planta distribution of phytoplasma in an annual indeterminate crop plant. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",213,1,excluded,Not birds

Parents may, however, trade off catering for embryonic requirements against their own need to forage through intermittent incubation. This dynamically adjusted behaviour can be affected by properties of the nest. Here, we experimentally showa novel mechanism by which parents, through incorporation of aromatic herbs into nests, effectively modify their incubation behaviour to the benefit of their offspring. Our study species, the European starling, includes in its nest aromatic herbs which promote offspring fitness. We provided wild starlings with artificial nests including or excluding the typically selected fresh herbs and found strong support for our prediction of facilitated incubation. Herb effects were not explained by thermal changes of the nests per se, but by modified parental behaviours. Egg temperatures and nest attendancewere higher in herb than herbless nests, egg temperatures dropped less frequently below critical thresholds and parents started their active day earlier. These effects were dynamic over time and particularly strong during early incubation. Incubation period was shorter in herb nests, and nestlings were heavier one week after hatching. Aromatic herbs hence influenced incubation in beneficial ways for offspring, possibly through pharmacological effects on incubating parents. Â© 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Native cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) is important for sediment accumulation and nesting habitat for endangered California Ridgwayâ€™s Rail (Rallus obsoletus obsoletus), and because salt marshes are typically nitrogen-limited ecosystems, previous restoration studies in California have used nitrogen fertilizers to increase plant growth. This study compared the use of two low-nitrogen, high-carbon fertilizers (Macrosystis pyrifera (kelp) and sodium alginate) to stimulate N2-fixing bacteria inhabiting the S. foliosa rhizosphere in a historic and recently restored marsh in San Francisco Bay. Alginate increased N2-fixation, though there was no observed S. foliosa growth response. Kelp suppressed N2-fixation, and increased the foliar nitrogen content of Salicornia pacifica in mixed Spartina-Salicornia stands. The restored marsh had less than 0.5Â Î¼M phosphate in porewaters, suggesting phosphorus, not nitrogen, limits S. foliosa growth in this marsh. Alginate increased rates of N2-fixation and may promote plant growth in marshes exhibiting nitrogen limitation. Phosphate limitation was a surprise considering numerous previous studies indicate nitrogen as the primary limiting nutrient of tidal marsh plants. We recommend first assessing nutrient stoichiometry when considering manipulations to promote plant growth in restored marshes. Â© 2017, Society of Wetland Scientists.",216,1,excluded,Not birds

Immune cells and endogenous SC-neural stem cells (SC-NSCs) play a critical role in wound healing processes, although both are ineffective to completely restore tissue functioning. The role of SC-NSCs in SCI and, in particular, whether such cells can interplay with the immune response are poorly investigated issues, although mechanisms governing such interactions might open new avenues to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Methods: We used two transgenic mouse lines to trace as well as to kill SC-NSCs in mice receiving SCI. We used Nestin CreERT2 mice to trace SC-NSCs descendants in the spinal cord of mice subjected to SCI. While mice carrying the suicide gene thymidine kinase (TK) along with the GFP reporter, under the control of the Nestin promoter regions (Nestin TK mice) were used to label and selectively kill SC-NSCs. Results: We found that SC-NSCs are capable to self-activate after SCI. In addition, a significant worsening of clinical and pathological features of SCI was observed in the Nestin TK mice, upon selective ablation of SC-NSCs before the injury induction. Finally, mice lacking in SC-NSCs and receiving SCI displayed reduced levels of different neurotrophic factors in the SC and significantly higher number of M1-like myeloid cells. Conclusion: Our data show that SC-NSCs undergo cell proliferation in response to traumatic spinal cord injury. Mice lacking SC-NSCs display overt microglia activation and exaggerate expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The absence of SC-NSCs impaired functional recovery as well as neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell survival. Collectively our data indicate that SC-NSCs can interact with microglia/macrophages modulating their activation/responses and that such interaction is importantly involved in mechanisms leading tissue recovery.

Declines are often attributed to low breeding success, with agricultural intensification and increased clutch predation quoted as causal factors. Conservation measures to improve breeding habitat have included raising water tables and creating a more diverse sward structure. The latter is often achieved by managing the encroachment of Soft Rush Juncus effusus. We review the literature on wader breeding habitat and consider how rush may be best managed to improve sward structure for waders. Rushes can provide cover for both nests and chicks, but, depending on species-specific requirements, may, if too dense, reduce both nesting and foraging opportunities. Rushes can be managed mechanically by cutting, chemically using herbicides, or by manipulating the timing and intensity of grazing by livestock. For cutting to have maximal effect on reduction of rush biomass and regrowth, the cut should be as short as possible and repeated or combined with livestock grazing, especially that by native breeds. However, some areas of rush should either be left uncut or regrowth timed to offer foraging and sheltering opportunities for waders. The optimal size and pattern of such areas, together with rush regrowth rates following treatment requires further research. Herbicides should only be applied using a weed wiper that allows precise application, thus avoiding impacting upon non-target vegetation and possible run-off into water sources. Sward management should be conducted outside the period April to June to avoid disrupting breeding birds. Â© 2019, International Wader Study Group, All right reserved.",218,1,excluded,Not birds

Sustainable forest management such as close-to-nature silviculture is needed. In this context forest management practices should be tested in regard to biodiversity. Therefore, we investigated the influence of gap formation and logging intensity on different functional groups in a close-to-nature managed fir-beech forest. Plots were selected in three areas in the Dinaric Mountains in Slovenia. In every area, nine plots were selected per area, of which three were established as control plots, three were treated with 50% logging and three with 100% logging. In every plot, the species of different functional groups were observed: ectomycorrhizal fungi, ferns, graminoids, forbs, hoverflies, carabid beetles and birds. For each of these groups, the species richness, species assemblage dissimilarity and indicator species were calculated for the different treatments. Ectomycorrhizal fungi and birds both responded to high logging intensity with a sharp decrease in the number of species; however, the results for ectomycorrhizal fungi were highly nested, while some additional bird species appeared. Graminoids and forbs were positively affected by logging intensity and saw increases in the number of species. Forbs had an almost completely new species assemblage compared to the forest species assemblages. Hoverflies were most favored by 50% logging, as these plots contained species from open areas and forest. Ferns and carabid beetles did not exhibit a response to different logging intensities. The number of indicator species was highly affected by the total number of species of the groups. However, which treatment they indicated was independent of the species richness but varied strongly per species group. The variability in responses shows that functional groups react differently to logging intensities, and the use of more functional groups improved the detection of changes due to logging. Fifty percent removal of the growing stock retained the diversity of most of the studied groups. The association of the group to vegetation structure, host species specificity or abiotic factors made them more responsive to the change associated with retention logging. The results are discussed in the context of forest management implications in regard to biodiversity. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.",228,1,excluded,Not birds

Such naturalized roughs, which often constitute 50Â % or more of a courseâ€™s total acreage, support biodiversity by providing habitat for pollinators and other wildlife. This study explored the hypothesis that they also serve as reservoirs of invertebrate natural enemies whose services extend to suppress pests in adjacent mowed turf. We used vacuum sampling, pitfall traps, and ant baits to compare arthropod populations in grassland or meadow-type naturalized roughs and traditional mowed roughs at two courses, and tested for spillover of biological control using sentinel eggs or larvae of a grass-feeding caterpillar exposed near or farther from naturalized areas into mowed turf. Although some natural enemies (e.g., spiders) were more abundant in naturalized roughs, we saw no direct spillover of predation which was quite high regardless of habitat type. Most likely that is because ground-nesting ants (Lasius, Solenopsis, and Pheidole spp.), which are dominant predators in this system, were equally or more abundant in the mowed turfgrass. Herbivorous insects, too, were more abundant in naturalized roughs, so prey availability may discourage solitary ground-dwelling predators from leaving those refuges to forage in mowed areas. There was no parasitism of sentinel eggs or larvae in our trials. Despite absence of direct spillover of predation, we argue that naturalized roughs might be more purposely designed and managed to promote parasitoids, insectivorous birds, and other enemies that provide diffuse biological control services elsewhere on the course.

Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.

Translational fusions eGfp:eGfp or Salp15:eGfp, including the enhanced-green fluorescent protein and the Ixodes scapularis salivary factor SALP15 genes, were constructed using the CaMV 35S (cauliflower mosaic virus) promoter, â€œPBmâ€� tick promoter (R. microplus pyrethroid metabolizing esterase gene) or the Simian Virus SV40 promoter.

In the nest the larvae are fed with the lipid-rich aril, and the viable seed is discarded. Benefits from secondary seed dispersal by ants are well documented for tropical plants, but benefits to ants from consuming vertebrate-dispersed diaspores are uncertain. Twelve captive colonies of O. chelifer were used to investigate the effect of aril consumption on larval development. Treatment colonies were supplemented with 1 g of C. canjerana arils, whereas control colonies were supplemented with 1 g of synthetic diet. Egg and larval production did not differ between experimental colonies after 5 mo. Aril-fed larvae, however, grew 3.5 times larger than those in control colonies. Essential fatty acids in the arils possibly account for improved larval development. Consumption of lipid-rich arils may be critical under scarcity of arthropod prey. Improved larval development through aril consumption confirms that this ant-seed interaction is facultatively mutualistic. This result is meaningful given the predominantly carnivorous diet of O. chelifer, and the generalized nature of ant-seed/fruit interactions in tropical forests. Whether or not benefits to larvae translate into significant gains for ant colonies is uncertain. Â© Cambridge University Press 2014.",249,1,excluded,Not birds

In contrast, a reciprocal transplant experiment was used to investigate the in situ adaptive response of the elevationally widespread epiphytic fern Asplenium antiquum to simulated climate change conditions. Fern spores were collected at three elevations and germinated in a greenhouse. The sporelings (juvenile ferns) were reciprocally transplanted to each collection site. Growth and mortality rates were monitored for 2 years. Wild sporelings were monitored at two sites to assess possible transplant effects. Habitat suitability, indicated by overall growth and survival patterns, declined as elevation increased. Only the highland population showed significant adaptation to the ""home"" habitat, achieving the highest survival rates. Microclimate data suggest that the presumed genetic adaptation at the highland site occurred mainly in response to drought stress in winter. Based on our previous study on species distribution models, which projected an expansion in the range of A. antiquum under future climate change scenarios, the populations at the upper margins of the species' elevational range may play an important role during this expansion, given their better adaptation to the shifting marginal conditions. Our study suggests that intraspecific variation should be considered when determining the potential impact of climate change on biodiversity.

There is no cure for OA, and no effective treatments which arrest or slow its progression. Current pharmacologic treatments such as analgesics may improve pain relief but do not alter OA disease progression. Prolonged consumption of these drugs can result in severe adverse effects. Given the nature of OA, life-long treatment will likely be required to arrest or slow its progression. Consequently, there is an urgent need for OA disease-modifying therapies which also improve symptoms and are safe for clinical use over long periods of time. Nutraceuticals-food or food products that provide medical or health benefits, including the prevention and/or treatment of a disease-offer not only favorable safety profiles, but may exert disease- and symptom-modification effects in OA. Forty-seven percent of OA patients use alternative medications, including nutraceuticals. This review will overview the efficacy and mechanism of action of commonly used nutraceuticals, discuss recent experimental and clinical data on the effects of select nutraceuticals, such as phytoflavonoids, polyphenols, and bioflavonoids on OA, and highlight their known molecular actions and limitations of their current use. We will conclude with a proposed novel nutraceutical-based molecular targeting strategy for chondroprotection and OA treatment.

However, direct environmental stimuli such as temperature, rainfall, or availability of food are thought to be important for fine-tuning breeding activities. Building on evidence from wild Island canaries (Serinus canaria), the authors had shown advancing effects of green vegetation on breeding under captive, short-day conditions. So far, the precise, sensory modalities of this stimulatory cue are unknown. Here the authors present new data that confirm advanced breeding activities in the presence of green vegetation and narrow its stimulatory components. They found that direct exposure of the birds to fresh green vegetation represented the strongest stimulus and advanced breeding by up to 2 months compared to controls. In contrast, access to artificial green vegetation, extracts from green vegetation, or olfactory components alone had no such effects. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first experiment that examines sensory components of an effective, supplementary, non-photoperiodic cue in a temperate zone species. The data suggest that in order to use non-photoperiodic information to time breeding, birds must be able to integrate and process multisensory stimuli. Single non-photoperiodic sensory cues are insufficient to affect the timing of seasonal breeding. Â© 2011 SAGE Publications.",273,1,excluded,no green nest material

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of pesticides formulations and mixtures on a South American caiman, Caiman latirostris, after in ovo exposure. We conducted a field-like experiment which simulates the environmental exposure that a caiman nest can receive in neighbouring croplands habitats. Experimental groups were Control group, Treatment 1: sprayed with a glyphosate herbicide formulation, and Treatment 2: sprayed with a pesticide mixture of glyphosate, endosulfan and cypermethrin formulations. Results demonstrated genotoxicity, enzymatic and metabolic alterations, as well as growth delay in caimans exposed in ovo to Treatments 1 and 2, showing a higher toxicity for the mixture. Integral evaluation through biomarkers of different biological meaning is highly informative as early indicators of contamination with pesticides and mixtures in this wildlife species.

ISSUE,63-69,2010,10.2174/1876325101004010063,"Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems evolved with short-interval, low intensity fires. Fire suppression has reduced or eliminated fire and has caused extensive changes in plant community composition and structure. The National Fire and Fire-Surrogate study was implemented to evaluate effects of alternative habitat treatments, such as herbicide application and mechanical thinning, and to compare them with effects of prescribed fire. We evaluated how treatments influenced the nesting success of birds breeding in 10-ha plots of longleaf pine at Solon Dixon Experimental Forest, Alabama. We measured daily rates of nest mortality for 432 nests of 33 species in unmanipulated (controls), burned, herbicide-treated and burned, thinned, and thinned and burned plots during the three years of our study. Although we accumulated observations of 6,624 days that nests were exposed to possible predation, sample sizes were still too small to permit robust statistical analyses of treatment effects. Data from one (Eastern Towhee, Pipilo erythrophthalmus) of two species with the largest sample sizes suggested that nests in treatment plots experienced higher rates of mortality than did nests in control plots, but sample sizes were still small enough that high estimates of variance prevented strong statistical evaluation. Nest survival for the other common species, Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), showed no such suggestive differences. We present results from all nests of all species for which we found three or more nests so that future researchers can use the data during meta-analyses. We also encourage those designing future similar studies to consider expanding the size of study plots so that at least the most numerous open-cup nesting birds can be found in sufficient numbers for strong statistical analyses. In longleaf pine forests of southern Alabama, we estimate that minimum plot sizes would need to be 50 ha for the two most common species, Eastern Towhee and Northern Cardinal.

Of 46 nests found (black-capped gnatcatcher Polioptila nigriceps, 2; red-breasted chat Granatellus venustus, 1; blue bunting Cyanocompsa parellina, 1; orange-breasted bunting Passerina leclancherii, 1; rufous-backed thrush Turdus rufopalliatus, 1; yellow-green vireo Vireo flavoviridis, 39), only one was parasitized (nest of a black-capped gnatcatcher). Experimental responses to taxidermy mounts suggested that yellow-green vireos may have had previous contact with cowbirds. We conclude that in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, parasitism by brown-headed and bronzed cowbirds (Molothrus aeneus) remains low, or even absent for some species, as on the yellow-green vireo, but this situation could change in the near future because significant developments for the tourism industry are planned adjacent to the reserve; that could create new habitat and sources of food for cowbirds.",282,1,excluded,no green nest material

The experimental design consisted of tree rows (containing four species of furniture timber trees, hazel bushes and grass alleys between the tree rows), forestry plots (comprising three species of timber trees and hazel bushes) and natural woodlots (consisting of mostly pine and beech trees). Forty tree sparrow nest-boxes with guards were constructed to study the structure of this model community. The material used for nest construction was determined based on a used tree sparrow nest obtained from a hedge at the field station. Numbers of arthropods found in tree rows were significantly higher compared to both the forest plots and woodlots. Similarly, the number of green lacewings, flies and beetles were all significantly higher in the tree rows than the forestry plots and woodlots. However, no significant difference between the varying resources of artificial nesting materials was found in total fauna. The common earwigs, Forficula auricularia were attacked by a tachinid fly, Triarthria. setipennis. The rate of parasitism was 43%. This tachinid fly was further parasitised by two hymenopteran, the pteromalids, Dibrachys. cavus and D. boarmiae. There were no significant differences observed between the brood sizes of the tachinid hyperparasitoids. Copyright 2010 Zoological Society of Pakistan.",283,1,excluded,Not birds
GNM_285,Chen2010,Nestin is essential for zebrafish brain and eye development through control of progenitor cell apoptosis,"Chen, H.-L. and Yuh, C.-H. and Wu, K.K.",PLoS ONE,5,2,NA,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0009318,"Background: Nestin is expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPC) of developing brain. Despite its wide use as an NPC marker, the function of nestin in embryo development is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: As nestin is conserved in zebrafish and its predicted sequence is clustered with the mammalian nestin orthologue, we used zebrafish as a model to investigate its role in embryogenesis. Injection of nestin morpholino (MO) into fertilized eggs induced time- and dose-dependent brain and eye developmental defects. Nestin morphants exhibited characteristic morphological changes including small head, small eyes and hydrocephalus. Histological examinations show reduced hind- and mid-brain size, dilated ventricle, poorly organized retina and underdeveloped lens. Injection of control nestin MO did not induce brain or eye changes. Nestin MO injection reduced expression of ascl1b (achaete-scute complex-like 1b), a marker of NPCs, without affecting its distribution. Nestin MO did not influence Elavl3/4 (Embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like 3/4) (a neuronal marker), or otx2 (a midbrain neuronal marker), but severely perturbed cranial motor nerve development and axon distribution. To determine whether the developmental defects are due to excessive NPC apoptosis and/or reduced NPC proliferation, we analyzed apoptosis by TUNEL assay and acridine orange staining and proliferation by BrdU incorporation, pcna and mcm5 expressions. Excessive apoptosis was noted in hindbrain and midbrain cells. Apoptotic signals were colocalized with ascl1b. Proliferation markers were not significantly altered by nestin MO. Conclusion/Significance: These results suggest that nestin is essential for zebrafish brain and eye development probably through control of progenitor cell apoptosis.

Previous studies have shown that cavity nesting forest birds such as woodpeckers forage and breed in MSMA treated pine stands. Here we examined the effects of MSMA in the laboratory using the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), with the objective to examine tissue distribution and sublethal toxic effects in a model avian species. Zebra finches were exposed to this pesticide at doses similar to those found in bark beetle samples from MSMA stands of trees treated in the southern interior of British Columbia (8, 24, and 72 Î¼g/g/d and a control group). Results showed high excretion (>90%) of arsenic in all dose groups, as well as dose-dependent trends in accumulation of arsenic in the blood (p < 0.001) and specific tissues. Monomethylarsonic acid, MMA (V), was the predominant form of arsenic in the blood plasma. Dimethylarsinic acid was the major form of arsenic found in the liver (83%) and kidney (61%) tissues. The brain tissue contained primarily the MMA (V) form (57%). Significant weight loss occurred in the two highest dose groups (p < 0.05).

Bird's nest Cyathus stercoreus is firstly recorded in Egypt. It was found growing on manured soil at New Damietta. It is identified and isolated from its fruit body. Eight basidiomycetes including C. stercoreus were tested to antagonize Ralstonia solanacearum (causal agent of brawn rot disease of potato) in vitro. All of these fungi inhibited the growth of R. solanacearum and the largest inhibition zones were recorded with Cyathus stercoreus Egyptian strain and Agaricus campester Egyptian strain. Extract from the Cyathus stercoreus mycelia was studied using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), Infrared (IR) spectroscopic analysis and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The study suggested that the polysaccharide of this fungus has the antibacterial activity. C. stercoreus was selected to green house study. Water extract filtrate of raw wheat straw (wers) and of spent mushroom straw (wess) of three Pleurotus sp. were tested to inhibit R. solanacearum growth by applying disc-filter paper method. RSE filtrate and all the other three filtrates inhibited R. solanacearum growth. Water extract of Pleurotus columbinus spent wheat straw (wess) had the largest inhibition zone, so, it was selected to further study. In greenhouse experiment, the previous selected factors were used to estimate their ability to biocontrol R. solanacearum. The reported results revealed that the mycelial suspension of C. stercoreus (Css) had the best effect in reduction of the disease, plant health and plant production. Consequently, this is the first report of using C. stercoreus in biological control of plant diseases. Using of spent straw and raw straw powders and their water extracts had good results in controlling the disease and plant productivity.

To achieve this goal, we generated a line of transgenic rats expressing a bacterial enzyme, Escherichia coli nitroreductase gene (NTR), under control of the nestin promoter. In this system, NTR+ cells are selectively eliminated upon application of prodrug CB1954, through activation of programmed cell death machineries. At 5 days of age, which is a time when cerebellar development is occurring, transgenic rats bearing the nestin-NTR/green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene are overtly normal and express NTR/GFP in neuronal stem cells, without any toxicity in these cells. The functional consequence of progenitor cell ablation was demonstrated by administering prodrug CB1954 into the cerebellum at this 5-day time point. Stem cell ablation in these neonates resulted in sensorimotor abnormalities, cerebellar degeneration, overall reduction in cerebellar seize, and manifestation of ataxia. In adult rats, GFP expression was not seen in the hippocampal progenitor cells and seen only at very low levels in the lateral ventricles, indicating a different NTR/GFP expression pattern between neonates and adults. In addition, application of CB1954 by intraventricular delivery reduced the number of 5-bromo-2â€²-deoxyuridine-labeled proliferating cells in the lateral ventricle but not hippocampus of NTR/GFP rats. These findings shows that targeted expression of NTR under a specific promoter might be of significant value in addressing the function of distinct cell population in vivo.

We have supplemented 16 pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, females with mealworms before and during laying and compared the mass and color of their eggs as measured on the day of laying to those of 16 control females with the same nest construction and laying dates and clutch sizes. Supplemented females laid significantly heavier and more intensely blue-green eggs than control females. Egg blue-green chroma was significantly associated with the amount of biliverdin in eggshells.

Apple orchards sprayed with pesticides in current use and reference sites were chosen for study in southern Ontario, Canada, during 2000-2001. We assessed thyroid hormone concentrations (plasma and muscle thyroxine [T4], and triiodothyronine [T3]) and the response to a challenge with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as parameters of thyroid histology. Individual nests were exposed to as many as seven individual pesticide applications and up to five pesticide mixtures. Concentrations of p,pâ€²-DDE in eggs from both species were highest in orchard sites, and ranged from 0.05 to 5.44 mg/kg wet weight for tree swallows, and from 0.17 to 95.4 mg/kg for eastern bluebirds. In 2000, tree swallows from sprayed orchards had elevated plasma T4 concentrations, and thyroid glands with collapsed follicles, hypertrophic epithelia, and higher follicular epithelial cells relative to chicks from reference sites. Plasma T4 concentration was positively correlated with the total number of pesticide mixtures applied during egg incubation through chick rearing. In 2001, basal plasma T3 concentration in tree swallow chicks did not differ between orchard and reference sites, though there were differences among orchards; T3 was positively correlated with total number of individual sprays applied during egg incubation through chick rearing. Tree swallows challenged with TSH showed no significant difference in thyroid hormone concentration or follicular epithelial cell height between exposure groups; however, a significantly greater proportion of chicks from reference sites were found to have thyroids with focal or diffuse hypertrophic epithelia relative to orchard chicks. In 2001, bluebirds from sprayed orchards had significantly higher T3 concentrations in response to TSH challenge; this response was positively correlated with the total number of pesticides applied during egg incubation through chick rearing.

We monitored vegetation density and abundance of birds during the breeding season during 1986-1990 in riparian, mesquite grassland, and Chihuahuan desert-scrub communities in the NCA. The density of herbaceous vegetation increased four- to six-fold in riparian and mesquite grassland communities. Little change occurred in herbaceous vegetation in desert scrub, or in the density of shrubs or trees in any of the communities. Of 61 bird species for which sufficient data were collected, mean detections per kilometer increased for 42 species, 26 significantly, and decreased for 19 species, 8 significantly. The number of individuals of all avian species detected on surveys increased each year from 103/kilometer in 1986 to 221/kilometer in 1991, an average annual increase of 23% (p < 0.001). The largest increases occurred in riparian species, open-cup nesters, Neotropical migrants, and insectivores. Species of the Chihuahuan desert-scrub, in which vegetation changed the least, showed the smallest increases. Only a few of the species showed increasing regional trends for the same period, as demonstrated by the North American Breeding Bird Survey; thus, increases on the San Pedro Riparian NCA were likely caused by the change in local conditions, not by regional effects. Our results suggest that removing cattle from riparian areas in the southwestern United States can have profound benefits for breeding birds.",318,1,excluded,Not experimental

In the case of the former, asymptotic expectations are generally derived (analytically or numerically) from analysis of the potential effects of perturbation of the elements of the life table. However, the vital rates that are indicated by prospective analysis to contribute the most to projected growth rate are not necessarily those that have contributed to observed variation in growth rate over time. We used a retrospective analysis to analyze the life table responses of a population of long-lived herbivorous geese to a systematic reduction in food abundance within the traditional breeding colony. Typical of long-lived species, adult survival rate has been shown previously in a prospective perturbation analysis to have the largest potential impact on projected growth of the population. However, despite a significant long-term increase in adult survival over the course of the study, there has been a long-term decline in growth rates of the population inhabiting the traditional sampling areas, although absolute numbers of individuals in both populations increased over time. Retrospective assessment of the relative contributions of variation in underlying vital rates (adult and juvenile survival, in situ recruitment, emigration and immigration rates into the population) to projected growth showed that the long-term dynamics of the nesting population primarily reflected the combined effects of changes in postfledging juvenile survival, while changes in the postnesting population were most influenced by variation in juvenile survival and adult fidelity rate to the traditional brood-rearing areas. Decreases in both juvenile survival and fidelity reflect systematic reductions in food abundance over the course of the study. Our results confirm previous suggestions that philopatry to the brood-rearing areas may be a significantly more plastic trait than fidelity to nesting areas.",325,1,excluded,Not empirical

Methods: Four of each type of filter - Simon Nitinol (SN), Bird's Nest (BN), Vena Tech (VT), Greenfield stainless steel (PSGF), Greenfield titanium (TGF), and the investigational stent cone filter (NGF) - were studied for 60 days in 12 sheep. Radiographic and pathologic outcomes to be assessed included clot capture and resolution, vena caval penetration, position of the filter, thrombogenicity, and vessel wall reaction. Results: Filters differed with respect to the number of clot-trapping levels and the interdependence of the legs. All devices were successfully placed. Intentionally embolized clot was captured. One VT and two SN filters migrated in response to clot capture. Resolution of thrombus was variable, and related to the design of the device. Fibrin webbing was widely present with the VT, BN, and SN filters but limited in the others. The VT and NGF filters demonstrated the most stable filter base diameter. Conclusions: The performance of vena caval filters differs with respect to clot resolution and mechanical stability. Interdependent filter limbs and single-stage conical capture sites appear to result in more favorable performance in in vivo studies.",326,1,excluded,Out of field

We have generated rat monoclonal antibodies (Mab 14H1 and 14B8) that recognize an RNA-binding protein Musashi1, but not a Musashi1-related protein, Musashi2. The amino acid sequences at the epitope sites of these anti-Musashi1 Mabs are remarkably conserved among the human, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. Spatiotemporal patterns of Musashi1 immunoreactivity in the developing and/or adult CNS tissues of frogs, birds, rodents, and humans indicated that our anti-Musashi1 Mabs reacted with undifferentiated, proliferative cells in the CNS of all the vertebrates tested. Double or triple immunostaining of embryonic mouse brain cells in monolayer cultures demonstrated strong Musashi1 expression in Nestin(+)/RC2(+) cells. The relative number of Musashi1(+)/Nestin(+)/RC2(+) cells increased fivefold when embryonic forebrain cells were cultured to form 'neurospheres' in which stem-like cells are known to be enriched through their self-renewing mode of growth. Nestin(+)/RC2(-) cells, which included TÎ±1-GFP(+) neuronal progenitor cells and GLAST(+) astroglial precursor cells, were also Musashi1(+), as were GFAP(+) astrocytes. Young neurons showed a trace of Musashi1 expression. Cells committed to the oligodendroglial lineage were Musashi(-). Musashi1 was localized to the perikarya of CNS stem-like cells and non-oligodendroglial progenitor cells without shifting to cell processes or endfeet, and is therefore advantageous for identifying each cell and counting cells in situ.

Singing in male European starlings is used to attract mates prior to physical sexual contact, suggesting that the POM might be involved. The present study was performed to examine the effects of lesions targeting the POM on singing and courtship behavior in reproductively active male starlings. A significant decrease in song output and the gathering of green nest materials was observed in males with lesions to the POM compared to males with damage to brain areas outside of the POM. Lesions did not affect a male's tendency to remain near a female or to occupy a nestbox, suggesting that the effects of POM lesions were specific to courtship behaviors. Behavioral differences were not related to testis mass or volume, and GnRH immunoreactivity was observed within the hypothalamus and median eminence for each male, suggesting that the effects of POM lesions were related specifically to POM involvement in song expression rather than to a disruption of the GnRH axis. These results suggest a general role for the POM in the expression of behaviors related to sexual arousal or anticipation, including song.",332,1,selected,

Particular attention is paid to the crossover between Luttinger and Fermi-liquid behavior as the interchain hopping (Formula presented) is varied. Although in the physically interesting case of finite but small (Formula presented) the quasiparticle residue does not vanish, the single-particle Greenâ€™s function exhibits the signature of Luttinger-liquid behavior (i.e., anomalous scaling and spin-charge separation) in a large intermediate parameter regime. Using realistic parameters, we find that the scaling behavior in this regime is characterized by an anomalous dimension of the order of unity, as suggested by recent experiments on quasi-one-dimensional conductors. Our calculation also gives insights into the approximations inherent in higher-dimensional bosonization; in particular, we show that the replacement of a curved Fermi surface by a finite number (Formula presented) of flat patches can give rise to unphysical nesting singularities in the single-particle Greenâ€™s function, which disappear only in the limit (Formula presented) or if curvature effects are included.

Our understanding of the role that these chemicals play in generating DNA sequence mutations is predominantly derived from laboratory studies with specific genotoxins or extracts of contaminants from environmental media. Most assays are not indicative of the germinal effects of exposure in situ to complex mixtures of common environmental mutagens. Using multilocus DNA fingerprinting, we found the mutation rate in herring gulls inhabiting a heavily industrialized urban harbor (Hamilton Harbour, Ontario) to be more than twice as high as three rural sites: Kent Island, Bay of Fundy; Chantry Island, Lake Huron; and Presqu'ile Provincial Park in Lake Ontario. Overall we found a mutation rate of 0.017 Â± 0.004 per offspring band in Hamilton, 0.006 Â± 0.002 at Kent Island, 0.002 Â± 0.002 from Chantry Island, and 0.004 Â± 0.002 from Presqu'ile Provincial Park. The mutation rate from the rural sites (pooled) was significantly lower than the rate observed in Hamilton Harbour (Fisher's exact test, two-tailed; P = 0.0006).

The clot-trapping efficiency and hemodynamic flow pattern of the filter were assessed in a flow model and were compared with those of currently available commercial filters including the Vena Tech-LGM, Simon nitinol, Greenfield, and Bird's Nest filters. The new filter was placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) of 31 dogs; 21 of the 31 dogs were followed up with cavography for up to 3 months. At the termination of the study, the filters and IVCs were examined grossly and histologically. An in vivo clot-trapping test was carried out in five dogs. The least turbulence was noted with the new filter and the titanium Greenfield filter. The stainless steel Greenfield and Simon nitinol filters caused major flow disturbances. Migration within 5 cm of initial placement occurred in two animals (9.5%). There were no IVC thromboses, perforations, or filter embolizations. An in vivo clot-trapping study showed an 80% efficiency for small thrombi (3 Ã— 20 mm) and 100% efficiency for large thrombi (6 Ã— 20 mm) with the new filter. The Simon and the new filter had the best clot-trapping capabilities. The Vena Tech-LGM and Bird's Nest filters were slightly inferior and the Greenfield filter demonstrated by far the lowest trapping capacity. The new vena cava filter is easily introduced percutaneously through a 12-F sheath and appears to be very promising due to its high filtering capability, low turbulence, nonmagnetic properties, good mechanical stability, and hypothrombogenicity.

Blood from 111 known-age, adult Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) nesting in several regions of the upper Great Lakes was collected in 1990 to examine bioavailability of PCBs, to compare concentrations of PCBs among nesting locations, and to determine relationships between concentrations of PCBs and age, productivity, and colony site tenacity. PCBs, DDE, dieldrin, and trans-nonachlor were detected in all the samples. Concentrations of PCBs were, on average, 10, 100, and 250 times greater than those of DDE, dieldrin, and trans-nonachlor, respectively. Concentrations of PCBs were not correlated with age, and were greater in Caspian terns from Saginaw and Green Bays than in Caspian terns from the North Channel and Georgian Bay. Concentrations of PCBs and DDE were significantly correlated with one-another and their accumulation patterns were the most similar among all the chemicals studied. Patterns of organochlorines as determined by cluster analysis were most similar for the nearest nesting locations. The bioaccumulation of PCBs in Great Lakes Caspian terns appeared to be seasonal and did not vary with adult age. A significant negative correlation was observed between mean concentrations of PCBs by region and percent terns returning to natal region.

Some developments may cause disturbance to wildlife. Knowledge of the way in which species respond to disturbance has been fragmented, yet is an important consideration in environmental impact assessments. This paper reviews what is known about disturbance factors on the best studied group, birds. A set of extensive appendices summarize the literature on disturbance effects on breeding, breeding success, nest-site choice, population density, community structure, distribution and habitat use. The paper considers human-induced disturbance, public access, water-based recreation, shooting and industrial developments. Mitigation measures are discussed. Human-induced disturbance can have a significant negative effect on breeding success by causing nest abandonment and increased predation. Outside the breeding season, recreation (particularly power boating, sailing and coarse fishing on wetlands) reduces the use of sites by birds. Compensatory feeding at night by some species can probably recoup some of the energy losses caused by disturbance. Public and vehicular access to open landscapes has been shown negatively to affect grazing geese in winter and lowland and upland waders during breeding. Shooting disturbance has been shown to be most important for herbivore feeders which need to spend long periods of the day feeding in order to maintain their energy balance, e.g. wigeon. The provision of refuges devoid of shooting has been fundamental in attracting wildfowl away from non-refuge sites. The response of birds to scaring devices and other control measures is discussed. Effects from industrial developments include direct loss of habitat, disturbance through the presence of humans during the construction process and the presence of artificial light used to illuminate construction sites. On estuaries, engineering operations should avoid the proximity to established roost sites of wading birds. A number of studies showed increased vigilance (and hence reduced feeding time) in flock members feeding near structures which impede their vision of the approach of potential predators. A number of principal management techniques used to reduce disturbance on a site, or to attempt to compensate for habitat loss, are given. For wetland sites, these include excavating new shallow lagoons and grading bank sides, flooding of low-lying pasture, reducing salinity levels in coastal lagoons thereby making them more attractive to the birds' food invertebrates, manipulating water levels to expose mud regularly and creating feeding areas for geese and wigeon, using manipulative livestock grazing. Also used are increasing nesting cover, planting macrophytes, providing islands, spits and promontories, purchasing more land to make a refuge bigger, concealing observers with banks and screens, zoning activities and prohibiting access and avoiding the obstruction of flyways between feeding and roosting areas.

In addition to eggshell thinning caused by high levels of DDT and metabolites, the reproductive impairment is characterized by high embryonic and chick mortality, edema, growth retardation, and deformities, hence the name Great Lakes embryo mortality, edema, and deformities syndrome (GLEMEDS). The hypothesis has been advanced that GLEMEDS in colonial fish-eating birds resembles chick-edema disease of poultry and has been caused by exposure to chick- edema active compounds that have a common mode of action through the cytochrome P-448 system. Detailed evidence has been collected from the following three groups of studies on herring gulls in the lower Great Lakes during the early 1970s; Forsterâ€™s terns in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1983; and double-crested cormorants and Caspian terns in various locations in the upper Great Lakes from 1986 onwards.

Choice experiments were conducted with 2 insects and a rodent which consume Cakile at Point Reyes National Seashore, where only C. maritima now occurs. Larvae of the moth Platyprepia virginalis (Arctiidae) displayed a significant preference for foliage of C. maritima in a laboratory test. No evidence of any foliage preference was found for the short-horned grasshopper Microtes occidentalis (Acrididae) in laboratory and field experiments. Experiments with deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus demonstrated a significant preference for C. edentula seedlings and fruits. Degree of preference by mice for seedlings was affected by distance from the experimental location to patches of introduced beachgrass Ammophilia arenaria, which mice use for nesting sites and cover, but this distance-dependence did not occur for fruit predation. Herbivory by the 2 insect species was not a factor in this case of species replacement. Peromyscus preference for seedlings and fruits of C. edentula would have affected the rapidity of local species replacement at Point Reyes, but this preference does not explain the current distribution of Cakile on the Pacific Coast.

Chicks reared with one of two aromatic oils subsequently discriminated between them and preferred the familiar oil when both were present in the test box. The preferences are likely acquired because naive, one-day-old chicks reacted similarly to wood litter treated with either water or oil.

Difficulties in the use of Nest Record Cards for this species (to obtain information from more sites) are discussed. Territory sizes tended to be smaller, and more feeding took place within territories, at Lindisfarne than at Mestersvig. Clutch sizes were similar in different areas. Incubation (mean period about 25 days) was shared fairly equally by the two sexes. Longer incubation shifts at Mestersvig and some areas at Lindisfarne than at other Lindisfarne sites were associated with greater distances between nests and feeding areas. Most egg losses were probably due to predation, and were fewer in the Arctic than in Britain, where nesting success varied greatly in different areas and years, and in relation to timing within a season. Up to five nestings per pair per year were made at Lindisfarne, but only one at Mestersvig. The timing of breeding is discussed, and it is concluded that the date of start of eggâ€�laying in northâ€�east Greenland is determined by the timing of snow clearance, while that at Lindisfarne is related to the decreasing probability of eggâ€�predation later in the season. Because of the high nest losses, the production of young at many temperate sites, including parts of Lindisfarne, was probably inadequate for the population to be selfâ€�supporting. The reasons for the large seasonal, annual and geographical differences are discussed. It is concluded that increasing predation probably determines the southern nesting limits of Ringed plovers, but that this limit may be modified by varying degrees of different types of natural and artificial protection, and extent of habitat suitable for egg camouflage. Increased human usage of nesting beaches probably has an adverse effect on nesting success, but because of the complexity of the number of interâ€�related factors affecting the latter, without field experiments it is difficult to predict how this could best be offset by protection measures.

Physiological and biochemical effects,"Peakall, D.B. and Miller, D.S. and Kinter, W.B.",Marine Environmental Research,8,2,63-71,1983,10.1016/0141-1136(83)90027-2,"The physiological and biochemical effects of ingested crude oil and their aromatic and aliphatic fractions were studied in nestling Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus). Single doses of 0Â·2-1Â·0 ml of two batches of South Louisiana Crude oil (SLC-76 and SLC-78) were used. SLC-76 caused marked retardation of growth, some disruption of plasma osmoregulation and hypertrophy of adrenal and nasal salt gland tissue; SLC-78 had no detectable effects on gull chicks. Weathering of SLC-76 for 36h did not reduce its toxicity and when SLC-76 was fractionated, the aromatic fraction was substantially more toxic than the aliphatic fraction.

The males are polygynous and each attempts to attract unmated females by a special display to the nest he has woven of strips torn from leaves of palms or grasses. Females prefer fresh green nests, and closeness of weave and external appearance did not seem to be as important as strength of materials. There was a high correlation between age of nests and their acceptability. Females ignore old nests that have faded to a dull brown, but painting such nests green did not restore their attractiveness. The fresher, more recently built nests were advertised the most to females by the male's display. Some females choose the same male and territory repeatedly for consecutive clutches or broods.
