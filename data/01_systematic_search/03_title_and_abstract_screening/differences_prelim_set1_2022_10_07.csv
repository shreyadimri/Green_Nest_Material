Gulls nesting near integrated steel mills showed significantly higher mutation rates than gulls from rural locations (Fisher's exact, P = 0.0004); urban sites without steel mills fell midway between steel and rural sites (difference from rural; Fisher's exact, P = 0.19). Distance of the nesting location of herring gulls from the steel industries' coking ovens was negatively correlated with minisatellite mutation rate demonstrating significant risk for induced germline mutations in cities with steel operations (Kendall Tau; Ï„ = 0.119; P < 0.0001).

In this study, we experimentally elevated T levels of monogamous males in the facultatively polygynous European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and compared mate attraction and paternal behaviour of T-treated males with those of controls (C-males). T-males significantly reduced their participation in incubation and fed nestlings significantly less often than C-males. Females paired to T-treated males did not compensate for their mate's lower paternal effort. The observed reduction in a male's investment in incubating the eggs was accompanied by an increased investment in typical female-attracting behaviour: T-males spent a significantly higher proportion of their time singing to attract additional females. They also occupied more additional nestboxes than C-males, although the differences just failed to be significant, and carried significantly more green nesting materials into an additional nestbox (a behaviour previously shown to serve a courtship function). T-males also behaved significantly more aggressively than C-males. During the nestling period, the frequency of mate-attracting behaviours by T-treated and control males no longer differed significantly. Despite the reduced paternal effort by T-males and the lack of compensation behaviour by females, hatching and breeding success did not differ significantly between T- and C-pairs.;167;2;selected;carried significantly more green nesting materials into an additional nestbox?;excluded;No green nest material included;selected;;excluded;No green nest material;;

The diagnostic suite included fast-x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) detectors, a time-gated x-ray pinhole camera, x-ray spectrometers, and laser shadow imaging. The main focus was made on the spectroscopic study of plasma evolution after the main x-ray burst though the data from photoconducting detector (PCD) and EUV signals over the whole period of current, and in addition laser shadowgraphy images before the main x-ray burst were analyzed. Modeling of the time-gated spectra recorded after the main x-ray burst indicates that the electron temperature Te either follows the PCD signals and peaks at times of the second (and the third if present) x-ray burst or has the higher value at the first frame (closest to the main x-ray burst), then slightly changes and increases at the last frame, which coincides with the second maximum of the current. It was also found that the values of Te never drop below 150 eV, and the EUV signal remains intense even when the PCD signal is almost zero.

Many fundamental features of SVZ migration are still poorly understood, and we addressed several important questions using two-photon time-lapse microscopy of brain slices from postnatal and adult eGFP+ transgenic mice. 1) Longitudinal arrays of neuroblasts, so-called chain migration, have never been dynamically visualized in situ. We found that neuroblasts expressing doublecortin-eGFP (Dcx-eGFP) and glutamic acid decarboxylase-eGFP (Gad-eGFP) remained within arrays, which maintained their shape for many hours, despite the fact that there was a wide variety of movement within arrays. 2) In the dorsal SVZ, neuroblasts migrated rostrocaudally as expected, but migration shifted to dorsoventral orientations throughout ventral regions of the lateral ventricle. 3) Whereas polarized bipolar morphology has been a gold standard for inferring migration in histologic sections, our data indicated that migratory morphology was not predictive of motility. 4) Is there local motility in addition to long distance migration? 5) How fast is SVZ migration? Unexpectedly, one-third of motile neuroblasts moved locally in complex exploratory patterns and at average speeds slower than long distance movement. 6) Finally, we tested, and disproved, the hypothesis that all motile cells in the SVZ express doublecortin, indicating that Dcx is not required for migration of all SVZ cell types. These data show that cell motility in the SVZ and RMS is far more complex then previously thought and involves multiple cell types, behaviors, speeds, and directions.

The speed of disappearance and permanence of these losses depend on a variety of factors, but the pattern of species loss appears more universal. We still do not understand the degree to which different mechanisms lead to population declines and local extinction in fragmented tropical landscapes. We review data currently available to evaluate three of the leading hypotheses, which include altered community dynamics producing mesopredator release and indirect effects of elevated herbivore populations; sensitivity of forest birds to altered microclimatic conditions in fragments, and the constraint of poor dispersal ability that reduces connectivity in fragmented landscapes. We find that all three mechanisms require additional study and suggest steps to be taken in future studies. Â© 2012 Dt.

Here, we investigated the potential role that gulls play in the dispersal of plants in Barcelona, a highly populated city of north-eastern Spain. We analysed the stomach contents of 145 chicks collected in urban nests and reported the presence of seeds of 27 plant taxa. We then developed a plant dispersal model based on the movements of 20 GPS-tracked yellow-legged gulls breeding in the city of Barcelona. We estimated seed dispersal distances, seed shadows and percentage of seeds reaching habitats suitable for seeds regurgitated in pellets and those excreted in faeces. Seven of the 27 plant taxa found in the stomachs were alien taxa to Spain. Average dispersal distances of plant seeds by gulls were around 700 m, but maximum dispersal distances reached up to 35 km. Dispersal distances and seed spatial patterns did not differ between faeces and pellet models, as most strongly depended on gull movements. About 95% of the seeds were dispersed within urban environments and between 20 and 30% reached suitable habitats for seed deposition (urban woodlands, green urban parks and urban grasslands). Urban gulls frequently dispersed seeds (including alien species) within urban habitats, both via direct consumption or via secondary dispersal after consuming granivorous birds that had ingested the seeds, such as pigeons or parakeets. Urban planning for Barcelona is based on native plant species, and thus, special attention should be paid to alien plants dispersed by birds, which could pose a risk to native biodiversity in urban ecosystems.

The colonization process, egg-laying dates, clutch sizes, and fledging success were similar among pairs of P. major nesting in orchards conducted under the three studied management strategies. However, the mean number of young produced per ha (orchard productivity) was significantly higher in organic orchards than in both conventional and IPM orchards. Such divergences between both fledging success and orchard productivity primarily resulted from higher densities of P. major nesting pairs, but also from lower rates of nest abandonment during incubation in organic orchards. We suggest that intensive pesticide use under both IPM and conventional managements may have resulted in a substantial reduction in insect prey availability that enhanced intraspecific competition, which then led to failure in reproduction in pairs with low competitive ability. Our results highlight the relevance of P. major in assessing the environmental impact of apple orchard management strategies.

We tested an integrated pest management push-pull protocol in the Atlantic Forest in SAo Paulo, Brazil, in an effort to prevent bee swarms from colonizing nest boxes (N = 30 in the forest plus five in aviaries) meant for use by Vinaceous-breasted Amazons (Amazona vinacea). Fifteen parrot nest boxes were treated with a permethrin insecticide to push scout bees away and each parrot box was paired with a bee trap box containing a pheromone lure to pull bees. Over a 1-yr period (March 2013 to March 2014), 29 insect colonies moved into 18 of the 35 trap boxes. Nine Africanized honey bee, three native Jatai bee (Tetragonisca sp.), and 17 wasp colonies occupied trap boxes. Only one experimental push-pull pair untreated parrot box was invaded by bees and no parrot boxes in aviaries were colonized. Four of the parrot nest boxes were occupied by birds during our study. Although none were used by Vinaceous-breasted Amazons, Southern House Wrens (Troglodytes musculus), Green-winged Saltators (Saltator similis), and Plain Parakeets (Brotogeris tirica) nested in the boxes and all nests were successful. Although long-term studies are needed before drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of trap boxes, our results suggest that a push-pull protocol may prove useful for reducing the use of nest boxes meant for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds by Africanized honey bees and other insects. RESUMEN Un esquema integrada de alejar-atraer para el control de plagas para la prevencion del uso de cajas nido para loros por las abejas de miel Africanizadas invasoras Las abejas de miel Africanizadas (Apis mellifera scutellata) compiten con los loros en peligro de extincion para las cajas nido y puede impedir los esfuerzos de conservacion. Probamos un metodo integrado para el control de plagas, el protocolo de alejar-atraer, en el Bosque Atlantico, en SAo Paulo, Brasil, en un esfuerzo para evitar que los enjambres de abejas colonicen las cajas nido (N = 30 en el bosque, mas cinco en aviarios) destinadas a ser utilizadas por el loro Amazona Vinosa (Amazona vinacea). Quince cajas nido fueron tratados con una insecticida permetrina para alejar las abejas exploradoras de las cajas nido. Las cajas nido tambien fueron emparejada con una caja trampa para abejas, que contenia una feromona para atraer las abejas. Durante un periodo de un ano (marzo 2013 - marzo 2014), 29 colonias de insectos se trasladaron a 18 de las 35 cajas trampa para abejas. Nueve colonias abejas de miel Africanizada, tres colonias abejas nativo Jatai (Tetragonisca sp.) y 17 colonias de avispas ocuparon las cajas trampas. Solo un experimento caja nido, emparejada con el metodo alejar-atraer, fue invadida por las abejas y ninguna de las cajas nido en aviarios fueron colonizados por abejas. Cuatro de las cajas nido estaban ocupados por aves durante nuestro estudio. Aunque ninguno fue utilizado por el loro Amazona Vinosa, los nidos fueron anidados por el Chivirin Raton (Troglodytes musculus), el Pepitero Verdoso (Saltator similis) y la Catita Tirica (Brotogeris tirica) y todos los nidos fueron exitosos. Aunque se necesitan estudios a largo plazo antes de sacar conclusiones acerca de la efectividad de la caja trampa para abejas, nuestros resultados sugieren que un protocolo de alejar-atraer puede ser util para reducir el uso de nidos de loros, y otras aves, por las abejas de miel africanizadas y otros insectos.;85;2;excluded;Not relevant;excluded;No green nest material included;excluded;Not relevant, No green nest material included;excluded;Not birds;;

There is a complex and species-specific interaction between these plant compounds and their avian seed dispersers. To determine whether two important secondary metabolites in wine grapes - tannins and colour pigments - might be important cues to two of the avian species that forage on wine grapes, and how species-specific this interaction might be, comparative field experiments were run with Australasian silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) and European blackbirds (Turdus merula). Both species were offered a glucose/fructose artificial nectar with increasing concentrations of grape tannins. In a second experiment, they were offered both green and purple artificial grapes where only the colour differed. Both species showed aversion to tannins; silvereyes appeared to have greater tolerance than blackbirds of tannin concentrations above 5%. In summer no preference was shown between green and purple coloured artificial grapes, but in late autumn blackbirds took only purple grapes whereas silvereyes pecked mostly at green. Links between tannin for seed protection and colour signals to birds are discussed. Colour may cue the two species to different species-specific aspects of fruit nutritive value. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Since 1980 research on the Gyrfalcon in the western Palearctic has increased greatly, especially in Iceland (O K Nielsen), Norway (P J Tommeraas and associates), Sweden (U Falkdalen and associates in Projekt Jaktfalk), and Finland (P Koskimies). Much new work has also been accomplished in the Nearctic, but unfortunately fresh data from Greenland and Russia lag far behind. The main recent findings and interpretations follow: field characters have been clarified to emphasize differences in appearance and flight behaviour between Gyrfalcons and other similar species. In most parts of the range, habitat associations are closely tied to the occurrence of Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopus and Ptarmigan L. mutus, the chief prey species of this predominantly resident arctic raptor. Its overall distribution has not changed significantly in the 20th century. Much new information on Gyrfalcon populations, especially in Iceland and Fennoscandia, indicates that although, in many parts of the range, breeding pairs fluctuate markedly in number in 4- or 10-year cycles-or sometimes irregularly-there has been little long-term change in overall population size in the last >50 years; however, there is evidence from Lapland that breeding density was much reduced around the turn of the last century, probably owing mainly to habitat changes and consequent reduction in Lagopus populations, secondarily to human persecution. Conservation should emphasize habitat restoration for grouse and other prey species, preservation of traditional eyries, and protection from human disturbance and persecution. Most Gyrfalcons specialize on Lagopus spp. for food summer and winter (60-90% of diet), but some, especially in the high Arctic, specialize on other prey such as Little Auks Alle alle, lemmings Lemmus and Dicrostonyx, and Arctic Hare Lepus arcticus. Gyrfalcons show both functional and numerical responses to changes in grouse density. Gyrfalcons more often use the stick nest of Ravens Corvus corax on cliffs or trees than any other nesting sites; tree-nesting Gyrfalcons in the Russian Arctic have been reported to refurbish old stick nests of other species for their own use. Breeding success depends more on spring weather than on food supply. Survival statistics are still meagre, and much research is needed. Body mass (weight) normally varies in individuals by as much as 250-500 g depending on sex and state of nutrition; males usually fall between 1000 and 1400 g, females between 1250 and 2000 g. The term 'morph' has been incorrectly applied to the Gyrfalcon's continuous variation in plumage from the whitest to darkest individuals. DNA and cross-breeding experiments show that the Gyrfalcon is most closely related to the Saker Falco cherrug and likely conspecific with it.";334;1;excluded;Non empirical;excluded;Observational;excluded;Out of field, No green nest material included;excluded;Observational;;

The physiological properties of immature GCs distinguish them from the more numerous mature GCs and potentially enables distinct network functions. To test how the changing properties of developing GCs affect spiking behavior, we examined synaptic responses of mature and immature GCs in hippocampal slices from adult mice. Whereas synaptic inhibition restricted GC spiking at most stages of maturation, the relative influence of inhibition, excitatory synaptic drive, and intrinsic excitability shifted over the course of maturation. Mature GCs received profuse afferent innervation such that spiking was suppressed primarily by inhibition, whereas immature GC spiking was also limited by the strength of excitatory drive. Although the input resistance was a reliable indicator of maturation, it did not determine spiking probability at immature stages. Our results confirm the existence of a transient period during GC maturation when perforant path stimulation can generate a high probability of spiking, but also reveal that immature GC excitability is tempered by functional synaptic inhibition and reduced excitatory innervation, likely maintaining the sparse population activity observed in vivo.

Internal dispersal was investigated by searching for seeds in faeces opportunistically collected at communal roosts, foraging sites and nests of eleven parrot species in different habitats and biomes in the Neotropics. Multiple intact seeds of seven plant species of five families were found in a variable proportion of faeces from four parrot species. The mean number of seeds of each plant species per dropping ranged between one and about sixty, with a maximum of almost five hundred seeds from the cacti Pilosacereus pachydadus in a single dropping of Lear's Macaw (Anodorhynchus leari). All seeds retrieved were small (<3 mm) and corresponded to herbs and relatively large, multiple-seeded fleshy berries and infrutescences from shrubs, trees and columnar cacti, often also dispersed by stornatochory. An overview of the potential constraints driving seed dispersal suggest that, despite the obvious size difference between seeds dispersed by endozoochory and stornatochory, there is no clear difference in fruit size depending on the dispersal mode. Regardless of the enhanced or limited germination capability after gut transit, a relatively large proportion of cacti seeds frequently found in the faeces of two parrot species were viable according to the tetrazolium test and germination experiments. The conservative results of our exploratory sampling and a literature review clearly indicate that the importance of parrots as endozoochorous dispersers has been largely under-appreciated due to the lack of research systematically searching for seeds in their faeces. We encourage the evaluation of seed dispersal and other mutualistic interactions mediated by parrots before their generalized population declines contribute to the collapse of key ecosystem processes.;79;2;excluded;Non empirical;excluded;Observational;excluded;Non empirical, Observational, No green nest material included;excluded;Not empirical;;

However, the importance of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in these adaptations are seldom studied. In birds, temperature could affect egg characteristics. Higher temperatures during egg-laying may reduce maintenance costs for females and allow a higher investment in reproduction. Yet, females may also use temperatures as a cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by approximately 1 Â°C throughout the entire laying period in great tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen), eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier. Lysozyme concentration decrease with the laying sequence in late clutches only. Thus, effects of temperature may also change with the laying sequence and it would be interesting in the future to tests the effects on first-laid eggs.

Neonatal character states are typically transformed, reduced, or eliminated during the first 10\% of their prereproductive development. Traditionally, neonates have not been distinguished from juvenile reptiles. As a result the neonatology of reptiles has rarely been addressed in past literature. Recent studies reveal a complex array of developmental scenarios involving character state transformations, heterochrony, unique character states in morphology, behavior, physiology, nutrition, dispersion and health. Unique morphological features (such as egg teeth) and limited skeletal ossification characterize many neonates. Distinguishing behaviors include ``reversal{''} movements, utilization of bright color patterns, and startling movements with both serving as anti-predation mechanisms. Prolonged association with protective parents, group migration, unique agonistic behavior, and tendencies toward rapid dispersion characterize the neonates of individual species. Neonatal physiological attributes include: a special availability to inoculation by symbiont fermenting anaerobes in herbivores, rapid conforming responses to their external environments in thermal and hydric exchanges, and in the case of some turtles, extraordinary capacities for supercooling (8.9 C). Post-paritive lecithotrophy (nutrition from residual yolk) sustain both the ovenwintering of nestlings and the dispersion of nonfeeding young for as long as several months. Resistance to infections (such as mycoplasmas) from their maternal parents,combine with nutritive reserves of residual yolk and a common tendency for rapid dispersion to make neonates attractive candidates for augmentation and translocation programs. Coupled with the practical advantages of maintaining and manipulating small animals in a laboratory environment, these qualities distinguish neonates as particularly useful models for experimentally evaluating the relative apportionment of reproductive resources into greater numbers of offspring or into improved quality/survivorship of individual offspring.;37;2;excluded;Not relevant;excluded;Not relevant;excluded;Out of field, Not relevant;excluded;Not birds;;

Male songbirds often learn songs from adult males during sensitive periods early in life, and sing to attract mates and defend territories. In presumably all of the 350+ parrot species, individuals of both sexes commonly learn vocal signals throughout life to satisfy a wide variety of social functions. Despite intriguing parallels with humans, there have been no experimental studies demonstrating learned vocal production in wild parrots. We studied contact call learning in video-rigged nests of a well-known marked population of green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela. Both sexes of naive nestlings developed individually unique contact calls in the nest, and we demonstrate experimentally that signature attributes are learned from both primary care-givers. This represents the first experimental evidence for the mechanisms underlying the transmission of a socially acquired trait in a wild parrot population.;105;2;excluded;No green nest material included;excluded;No green nest material included;excluded;No green nest material included;excluded;No green nest material;;

Less known is how supplementary environmental cues (e.g., nest sites, food availability) interact to influence key hormones and behaviors involved in reproduction, specifically in migratory species with gonadal recrudescence largely occurring at breeding sites. We investigated the behavioral and physiological responses of male European starlings to the sequential addition of nest boxes and nesting material, green herbs, and female conspecifics and how these responses depend on the availability of certain antioxidants (anthocyanins) in the diet. As expected, cloacal protuberance volume and plasma testosterone of males generally increased with photoperiod. More notably, testosterone levels peaked in males fed the high antioxidant diet when both nest box and herbal cues were present, while males fed the low antioxidant diet showed no or only a muted testosterone response to the sequential addition of these environmental cues; thus our results are in agreement with the oxidation handicap hypothesis. Males fed the high antioxidant diet maintained a constant frequency of breeding behaviors over time, whereas those fed the low antioxidant diet decreased breeding behaviors as environmental cues were sequentially added. Overall, sequential addition of the environmental cues modulated physiological and behavioral measures of reproductive condition, and dietary antioxidants were shown to be a key factor in affecting the degree of response to each of these cues. Our results highlight the importance of supplementary environmental cues and key resources such as dietary antioxidants in enhancing breeding condition of males, which conceivably aid in attraction of high quality females and reproductive success.

GNM_165;X.WOS.000184053000043;Herbicide and prescribed fire as habitat management tools for northern bobwhite in conservation reserve program fields;Greenfield and KC and Burger and LW and Chamberlain and MJ;NA;NA;NA;445-455;2001;NA;Kentucky-31 tall fescue (Festuca arundicacea) was a common planting established on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields throughout the southeastern United States during the late 1980s and 1990s. Fescue-dominated grassland communities on CRP fields offer poor quality nesting, brood-rearing, and foraging habitat for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) because of dense vegetation, high litter cover, low bare ground, and low plant diversity. Herbicide applications have been shown to reduce fescue and release early successional plant communities, and therefore may enhance bobwhite habitat quality. However, the relative efficacy of herbicide used in conjunction with fire has not been investigated. We tested singular and joint effects of herbicide (glyphosite) application and burning on vegetation in fescue CRP fields in east Mississippi. We tested the following 4 treatments: spring glyphosate application, spring bum, spring bum and glyphosate application, and control. All manipulations modified plant communities and enhanced bobwhite brood-rearing habitat to varying degrees. Spring bum increased bare ground and decreased litter cover (Pless than or equal to0.05). Spring herbicide application increased forbs, legumes, and annual weeds, but decreased grass and fescue canopy (Pless than or equal to0.05). Spring burn/herbicide application increased forbs, legumes, annual weeds, and bare ground but decreased grass canopy, fescue canopy, and litter cover (Pless than or equal to0.05). Canopy coverage of bobwhite food plants was greatest in spring burn/herbicide (Pless than or equal to0.05). Herbicide applied alone and in conjunction with burning enhanced bobwhite brood-rearing habitat in fescue CRP fields in east Mississippi by promoting early successional plant communities.

GNM_290;Jones20081;Biodiversity response to stand structural features in southern pine forests: A literature review;Jones, P. and Hanberry, B. and Demarais, S. and Wigley, T.B.;NCASI Technical Bulletin;NA;958;Jan 66;2008;NA;"The conservation of biological diversity is a high priority in managed forests of the southern United States. Forest certification programs require participants to have biodiversity management programs in place supported by up-to-date science and, in some cases, to have guidelines for retention of important stand-level habitat features important to wildlife. To meet this information need, we reviewed the scientific literature for information on relationships between stand-level habitat features and wildlife communities. Within this report, we give definitions and general characteristics of habitat features considered particularly important to wildlife management in southern forests. Because of the prominence of pine plantation management in the southern U.S., particular attention is paid to research performed in southern pine systems. We follow with a comprehensive examination of wildlife relationships to each habitat feature and an analysis of information gaps and research needs. We selected five habitat features for review: coarse woody debris (CWD), snags, den trees, isolated wetlands, and streamside management zones (SMZs). These features have demonstrated potential for impacting diversity, though their contributions in pine systems are not always well-documented. There were indications of other features with potential impact (e.g., fork-topped pines, roads), but there was as yet little evidence of their importance. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is used by a great number of wildlife species; however, few manipulative experiments have been performed in southern pines to determine whether this use is obligatory or facultative. While some species have shown responsiveness to CWD, benefits supplied by pine litter may substantially overlap those supplied by CWD in other forest types. Snags increase wildlife species diversity and richness by providing nesting and roosting sites for cavity-nesting species and foraging sites for insectivores. The effects of snag density are generally well-documented, at least for avian communities; however, the impact of snag distribution on communities of snag-dependent wildlife, both within stands and across the landscape, has not been adequately investigated. Den trees are mostly confined to hardwood species, and can contribute multiple habitat values such as mast and vertical structure. Den users are often highly selective, and may take into account features of the den itself, the immediate habitat, or the surrounding landscape. Den tree research in pine-dominated landscapes is almost completely lacking, and study of den trees in SMZs and retention patches could provide much-needed information regarding optimum density, juxtaposition, and distribution. Isolated wetlands, while individually managed at the stand level, involve definite landscape-scale considerations as well. Species associated with isolated wetlands may spend most of their life cycle in adjacent uplands, requiring knowledgeable management of both wetland and upland to insure their contribution to biodiversity. The impacts of silvicultural practices on communities associated with isolated wetlands are not well known, and most of the research conducted in pine systems is of limited scope. Long-term manipulative experiments, complete with pre-treatment data and adequate replication, are critical to understanding the disturbance regimes to which wildlife communities associated with isolated wetlands in different regions are best suited. Streamside management zones also involve both stand- and landscape-scale consideration. Because they contain a heterogeneous mix of habitat elements not always found in pine plantations, SMZs have the potential to greatly increase biodiversity in pine-dominated landscapes, to provide refuges for disturbance sensitive species, and to serve as population sources for recolonization of disturbed sites. Studies regarding the impact of SMZ width in pine-dominated landscapes have produced inconsistent and even conflicting results, and it seems unlikely that a single recommended width will suffice for all situations. Management of sites adjacent to SMZs may have as much or greater impact than SMZ width. We suggest research goals and methodology to address information gaps and research directions in southern pine forests. Long-term manipulative experiments are encouraged both to increase the power of researchers to test hypotheses and to account for long-term variation in wildlife populations. Wildlife responses to habitat manipulations should be measured using demographic characteristics rather than density alone. Statistical methods such as multivariate analyses should be brought to bear on questions of community ecology and response to habitat characteristics. Studies performed in natural pine and pine-hardwood forests can provide baseline material for comparisons with managed pines. There also is a need to improve knowledge of the impact of silvicultural actions, including herbicide use, on the dynamics of snags and CWD, and to develop reliable landscape-scale models to predict the results of management on stand-level habitat features.
