In rats interneuronal circuits at two levels of the spinal cord (i.e., L6-S1 and L3-L4) play an important role in this coordination. In the present experiments retrograde trans-synaptic transport of pseudorabies virus (PRV) encoding fluorescent markers (GFP and RFP) was used to trace these circuits. To examine the relative localization of EUS-related and BL-related interneuronal populations we injected PRV-GFP into the EUS and PRV-RFP into the BL wall. The PRV infected populations of spinal interneurons were localized primarily in the dorsal commissure (DCM) of L6/S1 and in a hypothesized lumbar spinal coordinating center (LSCC) in L3/L4 above and lateral to central canal (CC). At both sites colocalization of markers occurred in a substantial number of labeled interneurons indicating concomitant involvement of these double-labelled neurons in the EUS- and BL-circuits and suggesting their role in EUS-BL coordination. Intense GFP or RFP fluorescent was detected in a subpopulation of cells at both sites suggesting that they were infected earlier and therefore likely to represent first order, primary interneurons that directly synapse with output neurons. Larger numbers of weakly fluorescent neurons that likely represent second order interneurons were also identified. Within the population of EUS-related first order interneurons only 3â€“8 % exhibited positive immunoreaction for an early transcription factor Pax2 specific to GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory neurons suggesting that the majority of interneurons in DCM and LSCC projecting directly to the EUS motoneurons are excitatory.

Blue egg coloration has been suggested as a sexually selected signal of female quality to males, and some recent studies are in accordance with this hypothesis. Blue eggshell coloration results from the deposition of biliverdin pigment by laying females, which is a potent antioxidant. Thus, egg pigmentation should be costly in terms of antioxidants, an assumption of the signaling hypothesis that has not been tested yet. We induced increased reproductive effort in a set of female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca through nest removal and measured egg pigmentation and plasma antioxidant levels in relation with a control group. Experimental females showed a negative association between egg color and plasma antioxidant levels, while there was no relationship for control birds. This supports that egg pigmentation is costly in terms of general antioxidant defenses and suggests a tradeoff between the allocations to both traits. Furthermore, experimental females with more colorful eggs raised more fledglings, especially when breeding early. Controls did not show a relationship between egg color and reproductive success. Females laying more colorful eggs could have shifted their allocation decisions towards current reproduction, at the expense of their own antioxidant defenses. Our results highlight that blue egg coloration is a life-history trait, subject to tradeoffs with other attributes, and seems to be especially informative under harsh breeding conditions.

Concomitant investigations of MFO activity were conducted in starlings exposed to DMBA. Ethoxyresorufin Oâ€�dealkylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin Oâ€�depentylase (PROD) were used as indicators of hepatic MFO activity. Changes in MFO activity were compared to chemically altered immune responses following DMBA exposure. Subcutaneous exposure of adult starlings to 125 mg/kg DMBA resulted in suppression of lymphocyte blastogenesis and antibody production to SRBC. EROD and PROD activity were increased 2.8â€� and 3.4â€�fold, respectively. Lymphocyte blastogenesis was impaired in adult starlings orally exposed to 125 mg/kg DMBA. The immune system of nestling starlings exposed orally to 100 mg/kg DMBA was altered, as evidenced by decreased phagocytic ability of macrophages and inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Oral exposure to DMBA did not induce MFO activity in starlings of either age class. Effects of DMBA on immune function and MFO activity in starlings varied with the age of birds and route and length of chemical exposure.

Occupancy status of the boxes and reproductive parameters of the birds were recorded and analyzed. Occupancy rate of red boxes was compared to the average of the boxes in other colors pooled together. The occupancy rate of red nest-boxes was significantly higher than the average of all other colors combined for year 2007 (Ï‡2 =5. 51,df =1,0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05), 2008 (Ï‡2 =5. 51,df =1, 0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05) and 2010 (Ï‡2 =4. 65,df =1,0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05). An exception was found in 2009 when boxes with noticeable faded red color were used and resulted in a lower (Ï‡2 =4. 99,df =1, 0. 01&lt;P&lt;0. 05) occupancy rate than the average of nest-boxes in other colors. All these indicate that great tits do prefer the red-color nest boxes to the boxes of other colors. For breeding efficiency, there was no significant difference in clutch size among boxes of different colors in each year. The clutch size of red nest boxes was numerically lower than each of the other colors in 2010, but for the rest of the years it was numerically higher. The fledging number for red nest-boxes was significantly higher than the boxes of any other colors. When the mean of red color boxes was compared to the mean of all other colors pooled together, no significant difference was found between the clutch size of red nest-boxes and the average of all nest-boxes of other colors (F =1. 68, df =1, P =0. 59), however the red nest-boxes had significant higher fledging number than the average of all nest-boxes of other colors (F =17. 65, df =1, P =0. 04).

A special case is the secretion in the hoopoes Upupa epops, and green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus, which, contrary to the commonly white and odourless secretions, are dark with pungent odour. Recently, bacteria have been isolated from glands of both woodhoopoes and hoopoes and here we test the hypothesis that bacteria are responsible of some of the special properties of glands and secretions of this group of birds. We explore natural seasonal changes and intersexual differences in the properties of hoopoe glands and secretions, check the natural occurrence of bacteria within secretions, and analyse the effect of experimental injection of antibiotics on uropygial gland properties. Male glands underwent no seasonal changes, and their secretions were invariably white and odourless, very similar to female glands outside the breeding season. However, in comparison to the uropygial gland of non-breeding females, those of incubating females showed a marked increase in size and volume of secretion produced, which became dark and pungent. All these parameters increased until the hatching date and returned to values similar to those in the prelaying phase towards the end of the nestling period. Nestling glands produced secretions similar to those of females in colour and odour. Gland size of both females and nestlings predicted the amount of secretion produced. Microscopic techniques confirmed the presence of bacteria at high density and in active division in all dark secretions examined. The antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the load of enterococci in nestling glands, did not affect size of glands, but diminished the volume of secretion, which was lighter in colour than that of control nestlings. In nesting females, the experimental injection of antibiotic affected some measurements of gland size and secretion colour. Because the experiment did not affect general health estimates (immunocompetence, body condition or growing) of nestlings, our results suggest that some of the special properties of hoopoe glands are mediated by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.

Such naturalized roughs, which often constitute 50Â % or more of a courseâ€™s total acreage, support biodiversity by providing habitat for pollinators and other wildlife. This study explored the hypothesis that they also serve as reservoirs of invertebrate natural enemies whose services extend to suppress pests in adjacent mowed turf. We used vacuum sampling, pitfall traps, and ant baits to compare arthropod populations in grassland or meadow-type naturalized roughs and traditional mowed roughs at two courses, and tested for spillover of biological control using sentinel eggs or larvae of a grass-feeding caterpillar exposed near or farther from naturalized areas into mowed turf. Although some natural enemies (e.g., spiders) were more abundant in naturalized roughs, we saw no direct spillover of predation which was quite high regardless of habitat type. Most likely that is because ground-nesting ants (Lasius, Solenopsis, and Pheidole spp.), which are dominant predators in this system, were equally or more abundant in the mowed turfgrass. Herbivorous insects, too, were more abundant in naturalized roughs, so prey availability may discourage solitary ground-dwelling predators from leaving those refuges to forage in mowed areas. There was no parasitism of sentinel eggs or larvae in our trials. Despite absence of direct spillover of predation, we argue that naturalized roughs might be more purposely designed and managed to promote parasitoids, insectivorous birds, and other enemies that provide diffuse biological control services elsewhere on the course.

The experimental material was provided by 180 ROSS broiler chickens. One-day-old nestlings were divided randomly into 2 control groups and 4 experimental groups, in three replications, 10 birds each. The feed mixtures (Starter and Grower/Finisher types) were made of corn and extracted soy meal and they also contained fodder yeast, soy oil, mineral additives, premixes (with an addition of growth promoters or without) and an addition of dried green forage or dried herbs. The mechanical properties of the bones were determined on the basis of the three-point bend test performed with the use of an Instron 4302 apparatus coupled with a computer. The test registers as a graph the dependence between the force acting perpendicularly to the long axis of the bone and its deformation. An examination was performed to determine maximum force, and the maximum elasticity force. The studies revealed that both the type and the amount of the herbs determined chickens' growth and the physical and strength properties of their bones. The most beneficial effects were observed in feeding birds mixtures containing 1\% of pansy, since the values noted for all traits and indices were not worse than the effects obtained in the control group receiving antibiotic growth promoter, and in some cases they were even higher.

Mechanisms by which prey coloration provides camouflage has been widely studied. However, predator response to prey camouflage and concealment has received less attention. Understanding vegetation structure effect on depredation success could help managers design strategies to mitigate the depredation of managed species (e.g., threatened or hunted). We aimed to investigate the relationship between depredation rate, nest camouflage and concealment in ground-nesting birds of farmlands, and their predators. We set up an experiment of 2576 artificial ground nests to assess the role of egg coloration (white, light green, and dark green), egg size (small, medium, and large), and vegetation structure (vegetation height and land use) in nest survival rates. We also explored the role of predator searching strategies by analysing clumped depredation and multiple depredation events. Of the nests, 34.0\% were depredated, with corvids as the predators 78.5\% of the time. Corvid depredation decreased by 40-60\% in grasslands and spring crops above a vegetation height of 30 cm. In contrast, vegetation height and land use may be of far less importance in avoiding depredation by other predators. The probability of depredation was spatially clumped, suggesting that predators increase search effort in areas where a nest was previously encountered. Neighboring depredation and depredation repetition were more frequent in corvids than in other predators. Our study indicates that nests in vegetation higher than 30 cm had a drastic reduction in depredation rates by corvids. Management of vegetation structure is a key tool to mitigate depredation risk, and improving the availability of alternative food resources may be a complementary tool.",41,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Considering recent advancements in the field of direct transdifferentiation, conversion of astrocytes as a prominent component of glial scars to the progenitor cells that contribute to the repair mechanisms seems interesting. Recently, we have reported miR-302/367-mediated in vivo conversion of astrocytes into neuroblasts and neurons. In the current study, we used miR-302/367 and valproate (VPA) to show the possibility of conversion of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and myelinating cells in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced model of demyelination. Evaluation of behavioural impairment following CPZ and consequent to the treatments showed functional recovery from impairments. Enhanced remyelination was detected by luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining against two mature myelin markers, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein. Tracing of transduced cells with green fluorescent protein showed their contribution toward generation of new myelinating cells. These findings have suggested that in vivo specific targeting of astrocytes for forced expression of the miR-302/367 cluster and VPA administration may increase the brain's potential for repairing myelin insults by the generation of oligodendroglia from astrocytes. This finding may open a new avenue for enhancement of brain repair in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We assessed the costs and benefits of asynchronous hatching in the Greenrumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), a small Neotropical parrot that hatches large clutches very asynchronously. We manipulated eggs to create broods of four, six, or eight young that hatched synchronously or asynchronously. In a second experiment, we tested whether food limits offspring survival by experimentally feeding later hatched young in large asynchronous broods. We also examined the premise that food varies unpredictably by sampling seeds throughout several breeding seasons. Experimentally synchronized broods generally fledged as many or more young than asynchronous broods. Synchrony particularly outperformed asynchrony in broods of eight, where food demands should have been greatest. Nestlings had a higher probability of hedging from synchronous broods than from asynchronous broods, from small rather than medium or large broods, and if they were early hatched rather than later hatched. Most mortality in asynchronous broods occurred within 12 d of hatching, and a significantly greater proportion of later hatched chicks died with empty crops than did early hatched chicks. Later hatched chicks grew more slowly than their earlier hatched nestmates, but at fledging they were as heavy or heavier than earlier hatched chicks. Chicks from asynchronous broods were slightly heavier at hedging than synchronous chicks, but there was no correlation between hedging mass and the likelihood of being resighted in subsequent years. Cormack-Jolly-Seber model estimates revealed no significant differences in annual survival rates between young fledged from synchronous and asynchronous broods. Female chicks hedged from synchronous broods were recruited into the study population at a lower rate than those from asynchronous broods. Older chicks from reduced broods were less likely to hedge than chicks from broods that fledged all their young. Parents of large synchronous and asynchronous broods provisioned their young at similar rates and did not differ significantly in their subsequent survival. Females that raised experimentally synchronous and asynchronous broods showed no significant differences in the likelihood, timing, or success of their next breeding attempt. A marginally higher proportion of last-hatched chicks that received supplemental food survived to fledging than last-hatched control chicks, but feeding had no effect on penultimate chicks. Seed densities showed a high degree of autocorrelation over spans of 30-50 d. Asynchronous hatching appears to result in the mortality of the smallest young, due in part to the inequitable distribution of food among nestmates, rather than to food limitation, and as a direct result of the size disparities among nestmates. Thus, parrotlet parents appeared to derive no detectable short- or long-term benefits from the staggered hatching of their young through increased nestling growth and survival, reduced parental efforts, or increased parental survival. Although other adaptive benefits from hatching asynchrony are possible that were not tested directly in these experiments (e.g., `'insurance'' that some nestlings will survive), they seem insufficient to account for the extreme hatching asynchrony observed in the parrotlet. Instead, benefits to egg survival derived from the early onset of incubation may offset the costs of asynchronous hatching.",39,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

In such cages the quail hens show symptoms of pre-laying restlessness, The inability to perform normal pre-laying behaviour is regarded as one of the most important problems for the welfare of caged laying hens. The present study aimed at identifying key nest site stimuli for quails, to enable nest boxes to be designed for alternative housing systems. Groups of hens were kept in pens containing litter, nest boxes and dustbathing boxes. The type of nest box was varied between pens, and the incidence of eggs laid outside the nest boxes (floor-eggs) was recorded over periods of 15 days. In experiment 1 (8 groups of 30 hens), both the nature of the top of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) and the type of substrate in the nest boxes (artificial turf or hay) had a significant effect on the percentage of floor-eggs. Nest boxes with a top with slits and filled with hay were best accepted for laying. Nest boxes situated in the corners of the pens were significantly selected more often for egg laying than more central nests. In experiment 2 (8 groups of 14 hens), neither the nature of the sides of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) nor the colour of the nest boxes (green or brown) had a significant effect on the incidence of floor-eggs. In experiment 3 (16 groups of 14 hens with 2 or 3 cocks), the percentage of floor-eggs was significantly lower in pens with high (170 lux) than with low (15 lux) light intensity. There was also a tendency for nest boxes filled with chaff to be better accepted than nest boxes filled with hay. In experiments 2 and 3, in pens with floors half litter and half of perforated plastic more floor-eggs were found on the litter. Few eggs were laid in the dustbathing boxes in any experiment. This study shows that Japanese quail lay up to 90\% of eggs in nest boxes provided these are properly designed. It should therefore be feasible to develop housing systems with nests for Japanese quail which may replace conventional battery cages.

Here we examined the effects of MSMA in the laboratory using the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), with the objective to examine tissue distribution and sublethal toxic effects in a model avian species.

Clear assessment of the ecological and evolutionary impact of changing climatic temperature requires a natural system in which populations exhibit a direct unambiguous fitness response to thermal fluctuation. I monitored nests of a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination to investigate the causal relationship between local climatic variation in temperature and offspring sex ratio. Consistent with theoretical predictions, annual offspring sex ratio was highly correlated with mean July air temperature, validating concerns about the effect of climate change on population demography. This correlation implies that even modest increases in mean temperature (<2Â°C) may drastically skew the sex ratio. Statistical evaluation of the variance in climate change indicates that an increase in mean temperature of 4Â°C would effectively eliminate production of male offspring. Quantitative genetic analyses and behavioral data suggest that populations with temperature-dependent sex determination may be unable to evolve rapidly enough to counteract the negative fitness consequences of rapid global temperature change. Populations of species with temperature- dependent sex determination may serve as ideal indicators of the biological impact of global temperature change.",341,1,"excluded","Not birds"

The circuits and underlying molecular mechanisms appear similar between disparate avian orders and are shared with humans. An advantage of studying vocal learning birds is that the neurons dedicated to this trait are nested within the surrounding brain regions, providing anatomical targets for relating brain and behavior. In songbirds, these nuclei are known as the song control system. Molecular function can be interrogated in non-traditional model organisms by exploiting the ability of viruses to insert genetic material into neurons to drive expression of experimenter-defined genes. To date, the use of viruses in the song control system is limited. Here, we review prior successes and test additional viruses for their capacity to transduce basal ganglia song control neurons.

Shells of snails are the principal source of calcium for female parids and some other passerines during egg formation. Shortages in the availability of snail shells may lead to laying smaller eggs with thinner shells. In urban green spaces that require protection against pests, the numbers of snails may become greatly reduced in response to molluscicide treatments. The use of a molluscicide treatment against pest slugs in the Botanic Garden, LÃ³dz, Poland, in 2013 and 2014 provided a unique quasi-experimental setting to study the effect of molluscicide on both non-target snails and Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus eggs. Using a forest study site where no treatment was applied as a control area, we tested for effects of the molluscicide treatment in the Botanic Garden on the density of snails and on the egg volume of Blue Tits. We found that after the molluscicide treatment a dramatic drop in snail numbers occurred, which likely restricted the availability of snail shells for egg laying Blue Tits in the Botanic Garden. Correspondingly, egg sizes significantly decreased in the Garden, while they stayed constant over time in the forest. Eggs in bigger clutches were more strongly affected by the molluscicide treatment than eggs in smaller clutches. Our quasi-experimental study suggests that Blue Tits are sensitive to poor availability of snail shells. This is manifested by laying smaller eggs, which require less calcium to be incorporated in the eggshell, in response to a dramatic drop in the availability of snail shells.

Therefore, egg retrieval is an ancient, and likely ancestral, widespread behaviour in birds. However, it has received little attention in studies of avian brood parasitism, perhaps because most parasitism occurs in species with complex nests, a context in which egg retrieval seems irrelevant. However, for cavity-nesting hosts of avian brood parasites, egg retrieval may still play an important role in the coevolutionary interactions between obligate brood parasites and hosts, because egg retrieval can be considered to be antagonistic to egg rejection behaviour in hosts, yet both may involve cognition to recognize eggs. We hypothesized that (1) cavity-nesting hosts should retrieve misplaced eggs from outside the nest cup, (2) brood parasitism has modulated egg retrieval behaviour in cavity-nesting hosts and (3) hosts use the same visual cues for decision-making during egg recognition in both egg retrieval and egg rejection actions. To test these hypotheses, we performed a series of experiments in a cavity-nesting host, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus). Foreign eggs with different levels of mimicry were placed within or outside nest cups of hosts to test their responses. We found that host decisions about whether to retrieve or reject an egg both depended on the degree of mimicry. However, hosts sometimes first retrieved poorly mimetic foreign eggs and then rejected them. Alternatively, hosts sometimes failed to retrieve highly mimetic conspecific eggs. We suggest that egg retrieval in hosts is likely to be a result of the interaction between ancient retrieval behaviour and subsequent adaptation against brood parasitism.

Multi-unit electrophysiological recordings from olfactory nerves of adults indicated that strong responses were reliably elicited by volatiles from six plant species. After pairings of plant volatiles with gastro-intestinal malaise, birds exhibited conditioned avoidance in behavioural experiments, and made all possible pairwise discriminations between volatiles of the various plant species. Bilateral olfactory nerve cuts prior to conditioning abolished the ability to acquire avoidance, suggesting that olfactory cues mediated the response to plant species.

For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species) we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60% of species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional, provincial and national.

The island has been stocked with sheep for more than 100 years and during this period changes in vegetation and decreases in colony size have been noted. Exclusion of sheep from a portion of a colony did not increase hatching or fledging success, nor was there a decline in either the number of burrows or in burrow utilization, in the sheep-trampled areas. Indeed, sheep activity over colonies appeared to decline during the birds' breeding season and it was concluded that burrow damage was due mainly to the birds themselves, with major damage occurring in the fenced area during the breeding season. Comparison of burrow stability on Green Island with that in another colony, again suggested that birds were responsible for nest destruction but that renovation by the birds tended to nullify the importance of the damage.

However, in most studies the exact amount of light at night individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects, e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of light at night.

For each of 30 declining species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4) specific conservation measures and (5) agri-environment schemes. Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed-eating birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all 30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from options available in one or more agri-environment schemes. Four aspects of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1) weed-control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of hedgerows and `rough patches', have affected smaller numbers of species, as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at least eight species have shown recent increases in their national population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of agricultural practice is changed.",145,2,"excluded","Not empirical"

However, the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of rare species are seldom examined and are poorly understood. I tested several explanations of landscape-scale rarity in the New England cobble beach plant community, an assemblage of halophytic forbs associated with fringing beds of the marine intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora. Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the cobble substrate, thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species. Frequencies of the presence of forb species behind 387 sampled Spartina beds distributed along 120 km of shoreline in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, ranged from 0.005 to 0.382. Both the whole forb assemblage and individual species were strongly nested with respect to patch size and species richness. Species that were rare on a landscape scale were generally only found behind the longest beds, and bed length was positively related to species diversity. Experimental seed additions to 40 beds ranging in length from 8 to 688 m indicated that intermediate-sized beds often occupied by common species are not habitable by three rare forbs. When present behind the longest beds, these rare species are always associated with a microhabitat characterized by a relatively fine-grained and highly stable substrate. A series of substrate manipulations combined with experimental seed additions indicated that the rare annuals Spergularia marina, Salicornia biglovii, and Atriplex arenaria are restricted to the longest Spartina beds because smaller beds lack suitable substrate. These experiments also suggest that seed supply, competitors, and herbivores are not the proximate causes of the absence of these species from smaller beds, although dispersal limitation may prevent the colonization of many larger habitable patches.

As previously reported, cells derived from human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) or human bone marrow (BM) under certain in vivo or in vitro conditions can manifest neural features that resemble features of neural-derived cells, immunocytochemically and in some instances also morphologically. The present study explored how hematopoietic-derived cells would respond to neurogenic signals from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult and aged (6 and 16 months old) rats. The mononuclear fraction of HUCB cells was transplanted into the SVZ of immunosuppressed (single cyclosporin or three-drug treatment) animals. The triple-suppression paradigm allowed us to protect transplanted human cells within the brain and to explore further their phenotypic and migratory properties. One week after implantation, many surviving HUCB cells were located within the SVZ and the vertical limb of the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The migration of HUCB cells was restricted exclusively to the pathway leading to the olfactory bulb. In younger animals, grafted cells navigated almost halfway through the vertical limb, whereas, in the older animals, the migration was less pronounced. The overall cell survival was greater in younger animals than in older ones. Immunocytochemistry for surface CD antigen expression showed that many HUCB cells, either cultured or within the brain parenchyma, retained their hematopoietic identity. A few cells, identified by using human-specific antibodies (anti-human nuclei, or mitochondria) expressed nestin and doublecortin, markers of endogenous neural progenitors. Therefore, it is believed that the environment of the neurogenic SVZ, even in aged animals, was able to support survival, "" neuralization,"" and migratory features of HUCB-derived cells.

Here, we experimentally manipulated a male courtship display, the green plants carried to the nest by male spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor), without changing any physical attributes of the male himself, and examined whether this influenced female decisions on offspring sex ratio. We found that in an environment in which female starlings were producing more daughters than sons, experimental enhancement of the green nesting material caused females to significantly increase the number of male eggs produced and thereby removed the female bias. This effect was consistent in 2 years and at two localities.

Observational, comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to identify parasitic eggs (egg-nest contrast hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally test whether egg-nest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two colours: orange and green. Contrary to the egg-nest contrast hypothesis, host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn, experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg rejection rate.

The American thrashers exhibit great variation in egg colouration and patterning, and also show variation in male brood patch development. A recent hypothesis suggests that conspicuous egg colouration has evolved as the product of sexual conflict, where females may create conspicuous eggs to obtain greater amounts of male care, either in the form of male incubation or incubation assistance to prevent their eggs from being vulnerable to visually orienting predators and brood parasites. The American thrashers, a genus comprising of 10 species, exhibits striking variation in egg colouration and patterning, and also show variation in male brood patch development. By using avian visual modelling, I show that blue-green chroma of American thrasher eggs is positively related to their degree of conspicuousness against a nest background, while brown chroma is negatively related. Interestingly, the degree of male brood patch vascularisation is directly related to eggshell conspicuousness in American thrashers. I suggest that in the American thrashers, male brood patch vascularisation has evolved in response to conspicuous eggshell colouration to mitigate visual risks. Here I show that the degree of male brood patch vascularisation is directly related to relative paternal incubation effort in more than 300 North American breeding birds. This suggests that American thrasher species that possess both conspicuous eggs and brood patches, have most likely evolved to keep these conspicuous nest contents concealed, thereby reducing risk of visual detection.

Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year.

However, the importance of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in these adaptations are seldom studied. In birds, temperature could affect egg characteristics. Higher temperatures during egg-laying may reduce maintenance costs for females and allow a higher investment in reproduction. Yet, females may also use temperatures as a cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by approximately 1 Â°C throughout the entire laying period in great tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen), eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier. Lysozyme concentration decrease with the laying sequence in late clutches only. Thus, effects of temperature may also change with the laying sequence and it would be interesting in the future to tests the effects on first-laid eggs.

Experiments presented here examined the specific egg parameters to which 'rejecter species' respond, the relative tolerances rejecters show towards nonmimetic eggs and the degree to which rejection is limited to eggs of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), the only parasitic bird widespread in North America. Relative to cowbird eggs, American robin (Turdus migratorius) eggs are larger, blue rather than white and immaculate rather than spotted. Experiments using 10 egg models at 137 nests showed that robins respond to each of these differences (Figs. 2 and 3) but do not usually reject an egg that deviates from their own by only one difference. Eggs that differ in ant two of the three parameters are usually rejected. This built-in tolerance reduces the likelihood that robins will reject their own eggs if these are atypical in size or coloration. Small egg size was the most important parameter eliciting rapid rejections (i.e. within 1 day), probably because differnces in size can be detected by both visual and tactile perception. By contrast, small egg size was the least important parameter determining whether eggs were eventually rejected (i.e. within 5 days, Tables 2 and 3). In terms of their eventual response, robins may be more sensitive to egg coloration than to size because the latter parameter is less reliable in distinguishing between robin and cowbird eggs. Experiments were also carried out at 37 nests of the gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), whose immaculate blue-green egg is only slightly larger than a cowbird egg. Catbirds are much more responsive to white ground color than to maculation (Table 4), perhaps because color is more reliable in distinguishing between catbird and cowbird eggs. Rejecter species exhibit degrees of tolerance towards foreign eggs that are proportional to the divergence between their eggs and those of the cowbird. Birds with eggs strongly divergent from cowbird eggs benefit from being relatively tolerant because they avoid rejecting their own eggs but still act against cowbird eggs. Species with cowbird-like eggs must be relatively intolerant to maximize the chances that cowbird eggs are rejected. Experiments show that rejection is not specific to cowbird eggs. Thus, birds have apparently responded evolutionarily to brood parasitism by developing recognition of their own eggs, rather than by developing recognition and rejection specific to parasitic eggs.

Body condition is presumed to be determined by the quantity of food available to geese during autumn, winter, and spring migration. However, food resources likely do not limit populations that exploit agricultural systems. Other factors such as hunting, refuge management, diet quality, weather may affect survival and reproduction. We studied time-energy budgets, food intake, and body condition to determine how Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) of the Mississippi Valley Population (MVP) acquire and utilize energy and nutrients during autumn, winter, and spring migration during 1984-1989. Abundant food and behavioral flexibility allowed MVP Canada geese to exist on a high nutritional plane. Food intake was sufficient to meet or exceed daily energy and protein requirements except during winter. High energy, low protein diets fueled deposition of large lipid reserves, and were adequate to meet protein requirements during autumn in east-central Wisconsin. Late migrant geese that spent autumn in east-central Wisconsin expended more energy (x = 583 kcal/day) yet deposited more lipid (x = 4.51 g) compared to early migrants that spent autumn in southern Illinois (x = 526 kcal/day, x = 151 g lipid) during 1984 and 1985. Both groups averaged 4.5 hr feeding/day during autumn and consumed similar quantities (dry mass) of food (x = 187-190 g/day). However, late migrants consumed a high energy (x = 3.67 kcal/g) low protein (x = 12\%) diet comprised mostly of corn (x = 81\%) during autumn in east-central Wisconsin. Early migrants consumed a lower energy (x = 2.99 kcal/g) but higher protein (24\%) diet that consisted mostly of green forages (x = 24\% dry mass) in soybeans (x = 28\%) in southern Illinois. Wintering geese consumed a high energy (x = 3.49 kcal/g) diet with intermediate protein content (x = 19\%). Corn (x = 58\%) and soybeans (x = 22\%) comprised most of dry matter intake during winter in southern Illinois when daily energy expenditure averaged 536 kcal/day. However food intake declined (x = 152 g food/ day) during winter when geese averaged 3.5 hr feeding/day. Variation in crop food energy relative to population energy requirements on 2 southern Illinois refuges did not impact body condition during 1984-1989. Nutrient reserves contributed minimally (<1-6\%) to meeting daily energy requirements, so geese left winter refuges with more lipid and similar protein masses compared to early autumn. Geese exhibited a wide range of behavioral adaptation to spatial and temporal variation in food resources and nutritional requirements. Late migrants entered winter with larger energy reserves than early migrants during 1984-1989. Although early and late migrants were sympatric in southern Illinois during winter, they converged to similar levels of body condition by the end of winter during 1986-1989. Late migrants apparently used stored energy to reduce food intake, possibly to minimize mortality during winter. Early migrants apparently minimized exposure to hunting by feeding almost entirely within refuges during autumn. With smaller energy reserves, early migrants maintained higher levels of energy intake to maintain body condition after autumn, possibly increasing mortality risk during winter. We expected more similar trends in body condition between early and late migrant Canada geese, and more consistent losses of nutrient reserves each year if winter weight declines were driven by an endogenous physiological rhythm. We see no reason to invoke an endogenously driven physiological mechanism to explain winter weight losses in MVP Canada geese. Without controlled metabolic experiments, we prefer the simpler and more plausible explanation that winter weight declines result from facultative adjustments of feeding behavior to weather conditions, food availability, and pre-winter nutrient reserves. Overwinter survival should be enhanced by an energetic strategy that balances potential benefits and risks of feeding in relation to the size of remaining nutrient reserves. Decline of the early migrant tradition during the 1990's suggests that the energetic strategy of late migrants is more suited to recent harvest and refuge management regimes. Adults deposited 73\% (females) and 28\% (males) of their spring protein reserves while migrating between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Spring lipid reserves were acquired mostly (84\% in females, 92\% in males) during a 4-5 week staging period in east-central Wisconsin. Juveniles deposited 41-51\% of lipid reserves and 80-91\% of protein between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Feeding time (x = 5.8 hr/day), and food intake (x = 263 g/day) increased during spring-staging when lipid reserves more than doubled. Spring-staging geese consumed a moderate energy (x = 3.25 kcal/g) low protein (x = 13\%) diet that was more evenly composed of corn (x = 50\%), wild seeds and rootstocks (x = 21\%), and green forages (x = 27\%) compared to autumn and winter. Deposition of nutrient reserves was neither time- nor resource-limited during spring migration. Thus, food resources likely did not limit reproduction of MVP Canada geese under the conditions we observed during 1984-1989. Shallow wetland and moist soil habitats can be enhanced on southern Illinois refuges to benefit a wider diversity of wetland-dependent species and provide nutritional resources for geese without compromising energy available to support wintering populations. However, geese still need an abundant source of energy during autumn and winter, particularly when foraging opportunities are restricted by inclement weather or hunting. Food restriction on winter refuges during long and late-closing hunting seasons in the 1990's may have contributed to long-term changes in autumn migration patterns and wintering traditions in southern Illinois. Forage and non-crop foods are essential sources of protein and other nutrients during all seasons. but are especially important during spring migration. Shallow wetlands and lowland pastures on private lands in central Illinois and east-central Wisconsin are critical sources of non-crop foods that provide essential nutrients that geese use to complete the nesting cycle. Thus, reproduction could be impaired in the future if changing land use and farming practices reduce availability of moist soil and lowland pasture habitats.",164,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

Declines are often attributed to low breeding success, with agricultural intensification and increased clutch predation quoted as causal factors. Conservation measures to improve breeding habitat have included raising water tables and creating a more diverse sward structure. The latter is often achieved by managing the encroachment of Soft Rush Juncus effusus. We review the literature on wader breeding habitat and consider how rush may be best managed to improve sward structure for waders. Rushes can provide cover for both nests and chicks, but, depending on species-specific requirements, may, if too dense, reduce both nesting and foraging opportunities. Rushes can be managed mechanically by cutting, chemically using herbicides, or by manipulating the timing and intensity of grazing by livestock. For cutting to have maximal effect on reduction of rush biomass and regrowth, the cut should be as short as possible and repeated or combined with livestock grazing, especially that by native breeds. However, some areas of rush should either be left uncut or regrowth timed to offer foraging and sheltering opportunities for waders. The optimal size and pattern of such areas, together with rush regrowth rates following treatment requires further research. Herbicides should only be applied using a weed wiper that allows precise application, thus avoiding impacting upon non-target vegetation and possible run-off into water sources.

Although above- and belowground biota can both cause such mosaics, few studies have addressed their interacting effects. We studied multi-trophic interactions between aboveground vertebrate grazers, subterranean ants, plant-pathogenic soil biota (especially nematodes) and the vegetation in a temperate grassland. We found that when rabbits and cattle locally omit vegetation patches, yellow ants (Lasius flavus) respond to the taller vegetation by digging up more sand from deeper soil layers (hence making taller nest mounds), probably to maintain sufficiently high soil temperatures. We found that this ant digging affects other soil biota, as the mounds contain fewer plant-parasitic and fungivore nematodes. Also, the mounds have lower moisture content and soil bulk densities, and higher pH and available nutrient content than the directly surrounding soil. The clonal sedge Carex arenaria grows Vigorously on the mounds, producing more shoots and shorter rhizome internode lengths than in surrounding vegetation. Other plant species, such as the grass Festuca rubra, dominate the surrounding vegetation. A greenhouse bioassay experiment revealed that harmful soil organisms (as plant-parasitic nematodes and pathogenic fungi) outweighed the effect of beneficial organisms (e.g., mycorrhizae) in this system. Rhizome biomass and shoot production of C. arenaria were indeed inhibited less by biota in soil from ant mounds than by biota in soil from the surrounding vegetation. However, the total biomass production of C. arenaria was inhibited as strongly in both soil types. F. rubra was inhibited more strongly by biota in the surrounding soil. We suggest that various direct and indirect interactions between above- and belowground biota can contribute to community mosaics and hence diversity in grasslands.",168,2,"excluded","Not birds"

However, the vital rates that are indicated by prospective analysis to contribute the most to projected growth rate are not necessarily those that have contributed to observed variation in growth rate over time. We used a retrospective analysis to analyze the life table responses of a population of long-lived herbivorous geese to a systematic reduction in food abundance within the traditional breeding colony. Typical of long-lived species, adult survival rate has been shown previously in a prospective perturbation analysis to have the largest potential impact on projected growth of the population. However, despite a significant long-term increase in adult survival over the course of the study, there has been a long-term decline in growth rates of the population inhabiting the traditional sampling areas, although absolute numbers of individuals in both populations increased over time. Retrospective assessment of the relative contributions of variation in underlying vital rates (adult and juvenile survival, in situ recruitment, emigration and immigration rates into the population) to projected growth showed that the long-term dynamics of the nesting population primarily reflected the combined effects of changes in postfledging juvenile survival, while changes in the postnesting population were most influenced by variation in juvenile survival and adult fidelity rate to the traditional brood-rearing areas. Decreases in both juvenile survival and fidelity reflect systematic reductions in food abundance over the course of the study. Our results confirm previous suggestions that philopatry to the brood-rearing areas may be a significantly more plastic trait than fidelity to nesting areas.",325,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Since 1980 research on the Gyrfalcon in the western Palearctic has increased greatly, especially in Iceland (O K Nielsen), Norway (P J Tommeraas and associates), Sweden (U Falkdalen and associates in Projekt Jaktfalk), and Finland (P Koskimies). Much new work has also been accomplished in the Nearctic, but unfortunately fresh data from Greenland and Russia lag far behind. The main recent findings and interpretations follow: field characters have been clarified to emphasize differences in appearance and flight behaviour between Gyrfalcons and other similar species. In most parts of the range, habitat associations are closely tied to the occurrence of Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopus and Ptarmigan L. mutus, the chief prey species of this predominantly resident arctic raptor. Its overall distribution has not changed significantly in the 20th century. Much new information on Gyrfalcon populations, especially in Iceland and Fennoscandia, indicates that although, in many parts of the range, breeding pairs fluctuate markedly in number in 4- or 10-year cycles-or sometimes irregularly-there has been little long-term change in overall population size in the last >50 years; however, there is evidence from Lapland that breeding density was much reduced around the turn of the last century, probably owing mainly to habitat changes and consequent reduction in Lagopus populations, secondarily to human persecution. Conservation should emphasize habitat restoration for grouse and other prey species, preservation of traditional eyries, and protection from human disturbance and persecution. Most Gyrfalcons specialize on Lagopus spp. for food summer and winter (60-90% of diet), but some, especially in the high Arctic, specialize on other prey such as Little Auks Alle alle, lemmings Lemmus and Dicrostonyx, and Arctic Hare Lepus arcticus. Gyrfalcons show both functional and numerical responses to changes in grouse density. Gyrfalcons more often use the stick nest of Ravens Corvus corax on cliffs or trees than any other nesting sites; tree-nesting Gyrfalcons in the Russian Arctic have been reported to refurbish old stick nests of other species for their own use. Breeding success depends more on spring weather than on food supply. Survival statistics are still meagre, and much research is needed. Body mass (weight) normally varies in individuals by as much as 250-500 g depending on sex and state of nutrition; males usually fall between 1000 and 1400 g, females between 1250 and 2000 g. The term 'morph' has been incorrectly applied to the Gyrfalcon's continuous variation in plumage from the whitest to darkest individuals.

In this study, BMSCs were derived from the bone marrow of male Wistar rats (4 weeks old) through density gradient centrifugation (1.073 g/mL), and the cell purity of BMSCs was up to 95%. The combined injection of basic fibroblast growth factor and edaravone was conducted to differentiate BMSCs into neuron-like cells. In this study, 120 male Wistar rats were used to establish the model of semitransverse SCI; on the seventh day, neuron-like cells were labeled by BrdU and then injected into the epicenter of the injury of rats. On the 14th day after cell transplantation, the biotin dextran amine (BDA) fluorescent agent was used to track the repair of nerve damage. At 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after SCI, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale method was used to measure the functional recovery of hind limbs in rats. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blotting, and Real-time quantitative reverse transcripion PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to observe the regeneration of nerve cells. In the edaravone+BMSC group, behavioral analysis of locomotor function showed that functional recovery was significantly enhanced after transplantation of the cells, BrdU-positive cells could be observed scattered in the injured area and extended to both the head and tail, and the BDA tracer shows that the edaravone+BMSC group emits more fluorescent signals. Additionally, H&E staining, Nissl staining, and immunohistochemistry revealed that the space of spinal cord tissue was attenuated and the neurons were increased. Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Nestin, and neurofilament 200 (NF) were increased, while the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was decreased. TEM showed that cytoplasmic edema was reduced, mitochondrial vacuoles were attenuated, and nuclear chromatin concentration was declined after transplantation of neuron-like cells. Moreover, with the extension of time of edaravone+BMSC transplantation, the structures of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum tended to be normal.

This is crucial for longlived species, where increased parental effort in current reproduction profoundly affects future reproduction. Indication of reproductive value or willingness to invest in reproduction may promote matching responses by mates, thus reducing the conflict over care. In birds with biparental care, blue-green eggshell color may function as a signal of reproductive value that affects parental effort, as predicted by the signaling hypothesis of blue-green eggshell coloration. However, this hypothesis has not been explored during incubation, when the potential stimulus of egg color is present, and has been little studied in longlived birds. We experimentally studied if egg color affected incubation patterns in the blue-footed booby, a longlived species with biparental care and blue eggs. We exchanged fresh eggs between nests of the same laying date and recorded parental incubation effort on the following 4 days. Although egg color did not affect male effort, original eggshell color was correlated with pair matching in incubation. Exchanged eggshell color did not affect incubation patterns. This suggests that biliverdin-based egg coloration reflects female quality features that are associated with pair incubation effort or that blue-footed boobies mate assortatively high-quality pairs incubating more colorful clutches. An intriguing possibility is that egg coloration facilitates an equal sharing of incubation, the signal being functional only during a short period close to laying. Results also suggest that indication of reproductive value reduces the conflict over care. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",119,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Here, we investigated the potential role that gulls play in the dispersal of plants in Barcelona, a highly populated city of north-eastern Spain. We analysed the stomach contents of 145 chicks collected in urban nests and reported the presence of seeds of 27 plant taxa. We then developed a plant dispersal model based on the movements of 20 GPS-tracked yellow-legged gulls breeding in the city of Barcelona. We estimated seed dispersal distances, seed shadows and percentage of seeds reaching habitats suitable for seeds regurgitated in pellets and those excreted in faeces. Seven of the 27 plant taxa found in the stomachs were alien taxa to Spain. Average dispersal distances of plant seeds by gulls were around 700 m, but maximum dispersal distances reached up to 35 km. Dispersal distances and seed spatial patterns did not differ between faeces and pellet models, as most strongly depended on gull movements. About 95% of the seeds were dispersed within urban environments and between 20 and 30% reached suitable habitats for seed deposition (urban woodlands, green urban parks and urban grasslands). Urban gulls frequently dispersed seeds (including alien species) within urban habitats, both via direct consumption or via secondary dispersal after consuming granivorous birds that had ingested the seeds, such as pigeons or parakeets. Urban planning for Barcelona is based on native plant species, and thus, special attention should be paid to alien plants dispersed by birds, which could pose a risk to native biodiversity in urban ecosystems.

To clarify this issue, blood samples from 109 yellow-whiskered greenbuls Andropadus latirostris were investigated using both the microscopic examination of blood films and a nested mitochondrial cytochrome b PCR. The overall prevalence of Leucocytozoon spp. infection was 4 after the standard microscopic examination and 17 using the PCR diagnostics. Samples from 9 randomly chosen birds that were microscopy negative, but PCR positive, were then examined microscopically by screening 2 entire blood films from each individual bird.

Because of the PCR detection of sporozoites of unknown fate in the peripheral circulation, conclusions regarding the distribution of hemosporidian lineages in wildlife should be made with caution.

Recent studies focus on the role of eggshell colour as a postmating sexually selected trait of females which manipulates male parental investment. A basic prediction of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers. This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality, females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component. We discuss reasons for the absence of a relationship between egg colouration and female quality.

Neonatal character states are typically transformed, reduced, or eliminated during the first 10\% of their prereproductive development. Traditionally, neonates have not been distinguished from juvenile reptiles. As a result the neonatology of reptiles has rarely been addressed in past literature. Recent studies reveal a complex array of developmental scenarios involving character state transformations, heterochrony, unique character states in morphology, behavior, physiology, nutrition, dispersion and health. Unique morphological features (such as egg teeth) and limited skeletal ossification characterize many neonates. Distinguishing behaviors include ``reversal{''} movements, utilization of bright color patterns, and startling movements with both serving as anti-predation mechanisms. Prolonged association with protective parents, group migration, unique agonistic behavior, and tendencies toward rapid dispersion characterize the neonates of individual species. Neonatal physiological attributes include: a special availability to inoculation by symbiont fermenting anaerobes in herbivores, rapid conforming responses to their external environments in thermal and hydric exchanges, and in the case of some turtles, extraordinary capacities for supercooling (8.9 C). Post-paritive lecithotrophy (nutrition from residual yolk) sustain both the ovenwintering of nestlings and the dispersion of nonfeeding young for as long as several months. Resistance to infections (such as mycoplasmas) from their maternal parents,combine with nutritive reserves of residual yolk and a common tendency for rapid dispersion to make neonates attractive candidates for augmentation and translocation programs. Coupled with the practical advantages of maintaining and manipulating small animals in a laboratory environment, these qualities distinguish neonates as particularly useful models for experimentally evaluating the relative apportionment of reproductive resources into greater numbers of offspring or into improved quality/survivorship of individual offspring.",37,2,"excluded","Out of birds"

Nestlings reared in nests containing herbs carry fewer bacteria, have higher haematocrit levels and more basophile leucocytes, and have a higher fledging weight than those reared in nests without herbs. The incubation temperature is higher in nests with herbs than in herbless nests. Females are attracted by herb nests and herb nests provide energy-saving benefits to incubating females. In choice experiments, starlings employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can only discriminate odours during the reproductive season. The association between odour perception and reproductive behaviour suggests that increased testosterone production, related to the increasing photoperiod in spring, may guide these seasonal changes.

In addition, pairs with yarrow added to their nest were significantly less likely to suffer hatching failure and (or) brood reduction.

To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator-prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator-prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model.

Species-rich canopies (five or more species) in the reference marsh were taller and had more (13 vs. 7) layers than monotypes of Salicornia virginica, although both had 100% cover. Cover and layering were greater for three- and six-species plots than for one-species plots in both the field experiment (70 2 x 2 m plots, eight herbaceous halophytes) and greenhouse (same treatments). Cover (80-95%) and heights were similar among field experimental treatments after two growing seasons (18 mo after planting seedlings in April 1997). In years 3-4, heights (âˆ¼0.5 m) and cover (âˆ¼100%) were similar to those of the 1998 reference marsh data, but only 1-3 canopy layers had developed. Species effects became evident when assemblages were replicated in the greenhouse. The eight one-species treatments differed in cover, height, and layering, and complementary traits produced more layers in multispecies canopies than monotypes. Within the three- and six-species canopies, attributes were similar for most assemblages, but there was a slight height effect with S. virginica, as in the field. In general, the effects of individual species were best distinguished by heights, and species-richness effects by layering. Of relevance to the larger diversity debate is our finding that the attribute examined influenced perceptions of the importance of species number vs. species composition. To apply our results, managers would assess height and layering, not just vegetation cover. Salt marsh restorationists would establish species-rich assemblages in newly graded sites to accelerate the development of canopy height and layering. Monitoring efforts would continue until canopy architecture matches that of reference systems (>4 yr for Californian marshes planted on coarse, nutrient-poor soils). Finally, research on wildlife habitat quality (e.g., nesting potential for the endangered Belding's Savannah Sparrow [Passerculus sandwichensis beldingi]) would determine critical levels of canopy layering and height for nesting, feeding, and perching to defend territories.",35,2,"excluded","Not birds"

Single overall sprays applied between 200 and 250 accumulated day degrees (above a base air temperature of 3degreesC; degreesCd) and band applied treatments applied at 10\% or 20\% ground cover within the crop rows generally gave significantly greater weed biomass and seed rain than conventional treatments, while later band sprays (more than 650degreesCd) reduced seed return. Two overall sprays of glyphosate produced low weed biomass and generally lowest seed return of all treatments but tended to give some of the highest yields. However, the early overall sprays (200-250degreesCd) and band sprays gave as good or better yields than the conventional and were generally equivalent to the two overall-spray programme. Viable seeds in the soil after the experiment were generally higher following the early overall (200-250degreesCd) and the band spray treatments than following the conventional. The results show that altered management of GMHT sugar beet can provide alternative scenarios to those of the recent Farm Scale Evaluation trials. Without yield loss they can enhance weed seed banks and autumn bird food availability compared with conventional management, or provide early season benefits to invertebrates and nesting birds, depending on the system chosen.

These â€˜trophic cascadesâ€™ can be seriously disrupted by the local extinction of top predators. They can also be restored by the subsequent re-introduction of top predators by conservationists. Here, we investigated trophic cascades involving kÄ�kÄ�, puriri moths and their host trees. New Zealand kÄ�kÄ� (Nestor meridionalis, Nestoridae) are large parrots that were extirpated from most of its range in the 20th century. Unlike most other parrots, kÄ�kÄ� forage primarily by digging through the vascular cambium of trees in search of wood-boring insects. They regularly consume puriri moths (Aenetus virescens, Hepialidae), a giant species of ghost moth whose larvae tunnel into the heartwood of trees for protection. Puriri moths are host specific and frequently attack makomako (Aristotelia serrata, Elaeocarpaceae), a sub-canopy tree species. We conducted a field experiment in Zealandia, a nature reserve to which kÄ�kÄ� were reintroduced over a decade ago, to test the hypothesis that kÄ�kÄ� would increase tree fitness by removing larval parasites (i.e. herbivores). Contrary to our expectations, results revealed an additive, negative effect of both the predator (kÄ�kÄ�) and parasite (puriri moths) on plant fitness. Therefore, the tri-trophic interactions restored by the reintroduction of kÄ�kÄ� into Zealandia appear to be unique, as the actions of the predator decreased fruit and flower production, rather than increasing plant fitness, as typically reported for trophic cascades.

Nestin is also highly expressed in the glomerular podocyte, a type of terminally differentiated epithelial cell. Little is known about the significance of nestin in podocytes. Methods: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was injected into the rats to produce a PAN nephrosis model. Transmission electronic microscopy and terminal dUTP nick end-labeling assay were used to examine the podocyte foot process (FP) effacement and apoptosis, respectively. A mouse podocyte cell line was cultured and incubated with PAN. Immunoblot was used to examine the level of nestin expression both in vivo and in vitro. Enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged plasmids containing nestin shRNA were transfected into the cultured podocytes to silence nestin expression. F-actin arrangement within cultured podocytes was investigated by immunofluorescence, while the apoptosis rate was examined by both Hoechst stain and flow cytometry. Results: In the PAN-induced rat nephrosis model, podocyte nestin expression was increased in the absence of apparent podocyte apoptosis, even though the FP was significantly effaced. In the cultured mouse podocytes, PAN upregulated nestin expression in a time-dependent manner within 24 h of treatment. Notably, no significant apoptosis occurred, however knocking down nestin expression resulted in a remarkable derangement of actin cytoskeleton and an increase in apoptosis in the cultured podocytes 24 h after being incubated with PAN. Conclusions: Upregulation of nestin expression during PAN nephrosis could protect podocytes from apoptosis and that this process is mediated by maintaining the regular arrangement of actin cytoskeleton.

Although lightning-ignited fires were infrequent, the California Indians used fire to modify oak woodland vegetation for at least 3,000 yr. These high-frequency, low-intensity fires likely resulted in little mortality of mature oaks, low but continuous tree recruitment, an open understory, and a fine-grained mosaic of vegetation patches. Following settlement by Europeans in the mid-1800s, ranchers burned to reduce shrub cover and to increase grassland area and forage production; surface fires were common with average fire-return intervals of 8-15 yr. Fire suppression, begun in the 1940s to 1950s, led to increases in surface and crown fuels, invasion of woody vegetation in the understory, and increased tree density. In the absence of demonstrated fire effects on oak woodland birds, we used changes in vegetation structure expected to result from fire and fire suppression to predict the response of oak woodland birds to fire and fire suppression based on nesting habitat of 17 common oak woodland species breeding at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, California. Our results suggest that populations of Western Kingbirds (Tyrannus verticalis), Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and Violet-green Swallows (Tachycineta thalassina), would increase in abundance following fire, because they consistently nested in habitat similar to that expected to result from frequent, low-intensity fire. The species predicted to respond negatively to changes resulting from fire differed among the variables examined. If fire produces a mosaic of habitat patches rather than a homogeneous landscape, we expect that the differing habitat needs of most species will be provided for. As with fire, the most obvious change resulting from excluding livestock was an increase in shrub cover. The question naturally arises to what extent livestock grazing creates habitat similar to that created by historical fire, but this question remains unstudied. More fire-history research is needed to understand past fire regimes of oak woodlands and the effects of fire, including prescribed fire, on the vegetation and the bird community. The effects of grazing and the extent to which grazing mimics fire clearly require more study. We encourage others to test our hypotheses regarding responses of birds to variables expected to be altered by fire: shrub cover, tree density, and numbers of snags, saplings, and logs. Finally, we need to test our working hypothesis that a mosaic of habitat patches will provide the habitat conditions needed to sustain the high avian diversity characteristic of oak woodlands.",311,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Here I analyze the egg appearance of an East African weaverbird species that has variable eggs and is a host of brood parasitism by an egg-mimicking cuckoo, in order to (1) compare population variation to variation within a clutch as a measure of the distinctiveness of eggs; (2) assess modularity versus correlation among egg appearance traits as an indication of the complexity of egg signatures; and (3) address whether the eggs are discretely polymorphic or continuously variable in appearance. I also compare three methods of assessing egg coloration: reduction of spectral data to orthogonal components, targeted spectral shape variables, and avian visual modeling. Then I report the results of egg replacement experiments that assess the relationship between egg rejection behavior and the difference in appearance between own and foreign eggs. RÃ¼ppellâ€™s weaver (Ploceus galbula) eggs are variable in appearance between individuals and consistent within a clutch, but vary widely in the distinctiveness of particular traits. Most aspects of color and spotting are decoupled from each other, including coloration likely to derive from different pigments. Egg ground color is bimodal, with a broad continuous class of off-white/UV eggs and another broad class of blue-green eggs. Variation in all other traits is unimodal and usually normal in distribution. Females reject foreign eggs on the basis of the difference in brightness of the ground color and spotting of foreign eggs relative to their own, and the difference in degree to which spots are aggregated at the broad end of the egg. This aggregation is among the most distinctive features of their eggs, but the brightness of the ground color and spotting brightness are not; the birdsâ€™ use of brightness rather than the more distinctive chromatic variation to recognize eggs might reflect the salience of achromatic contrast in a dim enclosed nest.

Some developments may cause disturbance to wildlife. Knowledge of the way in which species respond to disturbance has been fragmented, yet is an important consideration in environmental impact assessments. This paper reviews what is known about disturbance factors on the best studied group, birds. A set of extensive appendices summarize the literature on disturbance effects on breeding, breeding success, nest-site choice, population density, community structure, distribution and habitat use. The paper considers human-induced disturbance, public access, water-based recreation, shooting and industrial developments. Mitigation measures are discussed. Human-induced disturbance can have a significant negative effect on breeding success by causing nest abandonment and increased predation. Outside the breeding season, recreation (particularly power boating, sailing and coarse fishing on wetlands) reduces the use of sites by birds. Compensatory feeding at night by some species can probably recoup some of the energy losses caused by disturbance. Public and vehicular access to open landscapes has been shown negatively to affect grazing geese in winter and lowland and upland waders during breeding. Shooting disturbance has been shown to be most important for herbivore feeders which need to spend long periods of the day feeding in order to maintain their energy balance, e.g. wigeon. The provision of refuges devoid of shooting has been fundamental in attracting wildfowl away from non-refuge sites. The response of birds to scaring devices and other control measures is discussed. Effects from industrial developments include direct loss of habitat, disturbance through the presence of humans during the construction process and the presence of artificial light used to illuminate construction sites. On estuaries, engineering operations should avoid the proximity to established roost sites of wading birds. A number of studies showed increased vigilance (and hence reduced feeding time) in flock members feeding near structures which impede their vision of the approach of potential predators. A number of principal management techniques used to reduce disturbance on a site, or to attempt to compensate for habitat loss, are given. For wetland sites, these include excavating new shallow lagoons and grading bank sides, flooding of low-lying pasture, reducing salinity levels in coastal lagoons thereby making them more attractive to the birds' food invertebrates, manipulating water levels to expose mud regularly and creating feeding areas for geese and wigeon, using manipulative livestock grazing. Also used are increasing nesting cover, planting macrophytes, providing islands, spits and promontories, purchasing more land to make a refuge bigger, concealing observers with banks and screens, zoning activities and prohibiting access and avoiding the obstruction of flyways between feeding and roosting areas.

If there is a cost associated with reduced male parental care, the relative benefit of mate attraction may be predicted to decrease as the size of a male's clutch or brood increases. We tested this prediction in monogamous pairs of facultatively polygynous European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). The larger the clutch, the more time the male spent incubating and the less time he spent attracting an additional female (i.e. singing near and carrying green nesting material into adjacent empty nest-boxes). Reduced paternal incubation resulted in lower overall incubation (the female did not compensate) and lower hatching success. Immediately after experimental reduction of clutches, males spent significantly less time incubating and more time singing and carrying greenery, and vice versa for experimentally enlarged clutches. Males with experimentally reduced clutches attracted a second female more often than males with experimentally enlarged clutches. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide experimental evidence for an adjustment of paternal care and male mate-attraction effort to clutch size. However, a trade-off between paternal nestling provisioning and mate attraction was not revealed, probably due to the absence of unpaired females by that time in the breeding season.

The effectiveness of progesterone, ultrasound deterrent and artificial dovecots for egg collection was tested in order to evaluate different approaches to feral pigeon population management in Ljubljana. The most effective method of pigeon control was the use of contraceptives, since the number of pigeons in selected locations of the wider centre of Ljubljana decreased by 49.1\% (P>0.05) in the period from 1999 to 2004. The method of ultrasound as a pigeon deterrent remains questionable, since no distinctive deterrent effects were established, even though pigeons in our experiment showed significant (P<0.001) signs of agitation when ultrasound was present in the tested area of the covered passage entrance to the urban landfill in Ljubljana.

On the basis of the predicted chicken NTE gene middle sequence and its 3â€²-end cDNA sequence, we cloned the gene sequence of chicken NTE activity domain (cNEST). The cloned cNEST gene is 1740 base pairs and encodes 579 amino acids, showing high identity with human and mouse NEST at amino acid level. The serine hydrolase signature motif GXSXG and the patatin domain were found in the cNEST sequence. Over-expression of cNEST tagged with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) in monkey kidney COS7 cells increased NTE activity significantly. The increased extent is similar to that in over-expression of hNEST cells.

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages.

By experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in the nests, to give the appearance that highly attractive males defended them, we induced females to increase their feather carrying rates. 4. The amount of feathers carried to the nest was correlated to female reproductive experience and laying date, two variables correlated with female body condition. These results suggests that this behaviour may work as an honest indicator of female quality. 5.

The Hawfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbill live primarily in woodland, the Greenfinch, Linnet and Goldfinch primarily in farmland, while the Bullfinch and Chaffinch breed, and occur throughout the year, in both these habitats. Habitat differences between species were probably more marked in primeval England than now, and the problems of studying animals in manâ€�modified environments are discussed in this context. Diet was studied by observation and by gutâ€�analyses of live and dead finches. Before roosting, finches usually accumulate food in their gullet, which is expandable but otherwise undifferentiated (the term â€œcropâ€� is thus inappropriate). The Lesser Redpoll, the smallest species studied, can store up to about 0.8 c.c. of food in its gullet, but the Greenfinch, one of the largest finches, up to 2.5 c.c. Among the Carduelis finches, the Greenfinch lives mainly on the large seeds of various trees, cereal crops and agricultural weeds; the Goldfinch on the seeds of Compositae; the Siskin on alder and conifer seeds; the Lesser Redpoll on birch and other small seeds; and the Linnet on the seeds of various weeds of farmland. The Hawfinch and Bullfinch eat a greater proportion of buds and seeds from fleshy fruits than do other finches; but the Hawfinch prefers larger ones than does the Bullfinch. The three European crossbills feed almost entirely on conifer seeds; specializing on different tree species. In summer, the Chaffinch and Brambling live largely on invertebrates but in winter on beechmast or small seeds taken from the ground. In winter, Chaffinches reaching Britain from northern Europe tend to feed in large flocks in open areas and to roost communally, while residents tend to remain near their breeding places and roost singly. The migrations and distribution of finches in Europe are described briefly. At any time of winter, closely related species with similar feeding habits are often concentrated in different parts of a common wintering range. Furthermore, in some species, such as the Goldfinch and Chaffinch, the sexes winter mainly in different areas. In Oxford, food was least readily available during hard (winter) weather and there was then complete segregation in diet between different species, but at other times their diets often overlapped considerably. The overlap was much more pronounced in the species living in farmland (which is an artificial habitat) than in those living in natural or seminatural woodland; some tentative explanations for this are offered. The fringilline finches, the Chaffinch and Brambling, feed their young entirely on invertebrates, are territorial in the breeding season and collect food mostly within their territories. The cardueline finches, on the other hand, feed their young mainly, or entirely, on seeds, often nest in â€œloose coloniesâ€� and usually gather food communally at some distance from their nests. The fringilline finches carry food in their bills to the young, which therefore receive small, but frequent, meals; whereas the carduelines feed their young by regurgitation and at longer intervals. Among the carduelines, the Hawfinch is exceptional in that seeds are first swallowed and regurgitated to the nestlings, whereas insects are carried in the bill. The Bullfinch develops in the breeding season special buccal pouches in which food is carried to the young. In general, most finches select diets for their young which differ from their own diets in the breeding season. The Crossbill and Linnet often feed their young on seeds alone, and some other species may do so occasionally. The breeding of these carduelines is therefore independent of a supply of invertebrates, but always coincides with an abundance of seeds. They breed at seasons when other birds do not; the most extreme cases are the three crossbills, which, given an abundance of suitable seeds, will nest at any time of year. The process of seedâ€�husking is described; the strength of the jaws, the extent of the gape and the width of the palatal grooves limit the size and hardness of seeds which a given species can take. No two species have bills of the same shape and size, and differences in diet between species are connected with differences in the structure of their bills and the way the bill is used. In general, the deeper the bill of a finch, the more numerous the types of seeds in its diet. The Greenfinch, Linnet and Redpoll have relatively short broad bills and feed more than do other Carduelis finches from plants whose seeds are relatively exposed (e.g. grasses) or enclosed within pods or capsules; they also pick up many fallen seeds from the ground, but each species concentrates on different sizes of seeds. The Goldfinch and Siskin have reIatively long, narrow bills and obtain much of their food by probing into cones and into the seedâ€�heads of Comâ€�positae; unlike other finches, they also use a gaping movement while feeding. The Goldfinch has a longer bill and eats more Compositae seeds than the Siskin, while tlie latter eats more tree seeds than the Goldfinch. Further, male Goldfinches have slightly longer beaks than females, and hence can obtain teasel seeds more efficiently; females feed only rarely from these plants. The Bullfinch and Hawfinch obtain much of their food by crushing fruits, seedâ€�heads, etc. in their bills and peeling off the outer layer to get the seeds. The methods used by the crossbill species to open cones of varying degrees of hardness are described in detail. The Chaffinch and Brambling obtain almost all their food by rapid pecks; they show none of the behaviour patterns used by carduelines to open various types of seedâ€�heads. Species also differ in the proportion of food obtained from the ground, from vegetation, or on the wing. These differences are related to the various positions in which each species is able to feed. Those species (Goldfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbills) which are most adept at clinging and hanging feed mainly from trees and herbaceous plants, while those that are least adept at this (Chaffinch and Brambling) obtain almost all their food from the ground or from firm horizontal twigs. The remaining species are intermediate in the proportion of time spent feeding from the ground or from vegetation; and only the Chaffinch, Brambling and Bullfinch obtain an appreciable amount of food on the wing. Differences between species in the frequency with which various positions are adopted during feeding can be related to differences in their average body weights, and (to a lesser extent) in their legâ€�structure; the most agile species are either light in weight or have relatively short strong legs. Bodyâ€�weight, legâ€�proportions and billâ€�size (and hence feeding habits) may vary considerably between different populations of the same species. In Appendix 2, the legâ€�proportions of certain English finches are compared with those of their German and Russian counterparts. Some finch species use their feet in coordination with their bill to obtain food. The extent to which various species do this in the wild is discussed in relation to the ease with which they can be taught experimentally to pull up food suspended on the end of a long thread. The ecology, structure and behaviour of finches is discussed in relation to some current ideas on speciation and the ontogeny of feeding behaviour. The young of several species of finches respond initially to a similar range of potential foodâ€�items (both in size and appearance) and all attempt to deal with them in similar ways. However, each individual soon learns to concentrate on those foods it can obtain most efficiently with its own particular structures and behaviour patterns. It is thus the structural and behavioural differences between closelyâ€�related species which lead the individuals of each to prefer different foods. Further, some of the behaviour patterns themselves probably develop mainly as a result of learning conditioned by structure, so that some of the behavioural differences between species that affect foodâ€�choice are in turn dependent on structural differences. This implies that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, two forms need diverge only in structure (and not necessarily â€œpsychologicallyâ€�) for some ecological segregation to be achieved. There are, however, certain differences in feeding behaviour between the fringillines and carduelines that cannot be attributed merely to structural differences between the two groups, so presumably some â€œpsychological factorâ€� is also important in the development of these particular behaviour patterns. A close relationship between the structure, feeding behaviour and food of an animal is usually taken for granted, but it is often difficult to decide which of these came first in evolution. Among finches, however, there are sometimes indications that a structural change was necessary before a new behaviour pattern or feeding habit could evolve, though further modification of structure may then occur through adaptation to the new foods thereby made available. Some evolutionary trends among finches are described, and the role of competition in the evolution and maintenance of ecological differences between species is discussed. The effect of social experience on feeding behaviour is also discussed, and some examples are given of the spread of novel foodâ€�habits among finches, and of presumed traditional differences in feeding behaviour between different populations of the same species. Finally, some recent changes in food, and habitatâ€�selection by finches are discussed in relation to problems of conservation. Copyright Â© 1967, Wiley Blackwell.

In this study, we explore treatments in the postacute phase of stroke with wider windows of opportunity. We investigated the effects of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1Î±) in neurovascular recovery during the postacute phase and downstream signaling pathways, underlying SDF-1Î±-mediated neurovascular recovery. METHODS-: Adult male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion. One week after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the animals received stereotactic injection of adenoassociated virus (AAV) carrying SDF-1Î± gene as treatment or AAV-green fluorescent protein as control and were monitored for 5 weeks. Neurobehavioral outcomes were evaluated, and brain atrophy was measured. Neurogenesis and angiogenesis were examined. The proliferation and migration of neural progenitor cells were evaluated. Downstream pathways of SDF-1Î± were investigated. Inflammatory response was monitored. RESULTS-: Neurobehavioral outcomes were improved, and brain atrophy was greatly reduced for â‰¤5 weeks in AAV-SDF-1Î± groups when compared with the control. SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 was upregulated and colocalized with neural and endothelial progenitor cells. The number of nestin and doublecortin/bromodeoxyuridine cells in the subventricular zone, doublecortin and neuron/bromodeoxyuridine cells in the perifocal region, and cluster of differentiation (CD)31 and bromodeoxyuridine/ CD31 microvessels are also significantly increased in AAV-SDF-1Î± groups. Administration of CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 eliminated the beneficial effects of SDF-1Î±. SDF-1Î±/CXCR4 interaction activated AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways but not the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. CONCLUSIONS-: SDF-1Î± promoted neurogenesis and angiogenesis during the postacute phase of ischemia without eliciting an inflammatory response. AAV-SDF-1Î± expression represents a promising avenue for ischemic stroke therapy with a wider treatment window. Â© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",257,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Nitrogen, which is required in the greatest quantity of all mineral nutrients absorbed by plant roots, is an essential component of protein. While the beneficial effects of fertilizer N application on crop production are well documented, concern on the long-term role of fertilizer N in maintaining soil productivity, crop quality (including elemental composition and balance, protein, oil, fatty acids), and environmental safety is being expressed more frequently in recent years. The long-term strategy of N use in agriculture likely will involve increased reliance on fertilizer N, biological N fixation (BNF) by leguminous crops, and wastes (including farm, urban, and industrial wastes) and their efficient management. Recovery of applied N by crops in field experiments has been found commonly ranging from 25 to 34% for rice (Oryza sativa L.) and 40 to 60% for other crops, with the global average value of about 50% (Mosier, 2002). Unutilized N may remain in the soil in various forms and/or get lost through several processes, including NH3 volatilization, denitrification, and nitrate leaching, which have been discussed in detail in several reviews (Aulakh et al., 1992; Carpenter et al., 1998; Goulding, 2004; Guillard et al., 1995; Malhi et al., 1991, 2002a; Singh et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995). For enhancing applied nitrogen use efficiency by crops (NUE), several management techniques have been developed for different soils, crops, seasons, and regions. Examples of these include (a) integrated and judicious use of chemical fertilizers and organic manures, (b) synchronizing N supply with crop need by split applications during crop growth, (c) reducing loss of applied N with nest or band placement or large urea granules in soil, and (d) use of slow-release fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors (Aulakh, 1994; Keeney, 1982; Malhi and Nyborg, 1985, 1988; Nyborg and Malhi, 1992). The amounts of different nutrients absorbed by a crop from soil may vary 10,000-fold, from 200 kg of N ha-1 to less than 20 g of Mo ha-1, and yet rarely do these nutrients work in isolation. As agriculture becomes more intensive, the extent and severity of nutrient deficiencies and the practical significance of nutrient interactions increase. Interactions among nutrients occur when the supply of one nutrient affects the absorption, distribution, or function of another nutrient (Robson and Pitman, 1983). In crop production, nutrient interactions assume added significance by affecting crop productivity and returns from investments made by farmers in fertilizers. Interaction between two or more nutrients can be positive (synergistic), negative (antagonistic), or even absent (reflected as additive effect). When the effect of one factor (e.g., nutrient) is influenced by the effect of another factor, the two factors are said to interact. When the crop yield reaches an early plateau, it may be due to the limiting supplies of another nutrient illustrating the operation of Liebig's ""law of the minimum"" (Cooke and Gething, 1978). When that nutrient is supplied, yield will continue to increase until another factor becomes limiting. When solar radiation, temperature, and soil water availability are nonlimiting, plant nutrient requirements will be higher; for which Wallace (1990) proposed the ""law of the maximum"" in contrast to the ""law of minimum."" The law of maximum states that when the need is fully satisfied for every factor involved in the process, the rate of the process can be at its maximum potential, which is greater than the sum of its parts because of a sequentially additive interaction (Wallace, 1990). Production of field crops has already entered into the stage of multiple nutrient deficiencies management. For instance, in south Asia, a farmer in the rice-wheat belt needs to manage four to six nutrients to safeguard and sustain an annual harvest of 10 tons grain ha-1, whereas a tea planter in India targeting for a yield of over 4.5 tons tea ha-1 must worry about seven to eight nutrients. Thus, when the combined effect of two factors is more than their additive effects, the interaction is positive. When their combined effect is less than their additive effects, the interaction is negative. Therefore, just because factor A + factor B plot produces a higher yield than either A-treated or B-treated plot does not mean that there is a positive A Ã— B interaction. A brief review on the interaction effects of N with P, K, S, and Cu has been given previously (Aulakh and Malhi, 2004). As N function in plant growth and nutrition is closely connected to C, the C/N ratio controls N availability and potentially affects interactions through the processes of organic residue decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) formation in soil, biomass production (photosynthesis minus respiration) in plant, and energy flow in and through all levels of the ecosystem (Wilkinson et al., 2000). An understanding of the nature of different interactions, factors affecting them, and the ways and means of managing these for useful purposes is vital for developing, advocating, and practicing a balanced and efficient crop nutrient management strategy. Identification and exploitation of positive interactions hold the key for increasing returns in terms of crop yield, produce quality, and nutrient use efficiency from applied N. Knowledge of the negative interactions is equally valuable because the test of ""precision crop nutrition"" lies in the ability to minimize the losses from antagonistic effects. Nutrient interactions have a role to play in determining the course and outcome of two major issues of interest in fertilizer management, namely balanced fertilizer input and efficient fertilizer use. This article reviews and analyzes the available information to (a) examine the impact of interactions of applied N with other nutrients, nutrient cycles, and water on NUE, (b) consider the influence of NUE on the utilization of other nutrients and water, and on C sequestration and storage in soil, (c) compute relative consumption of major fertilizer nutrients (N, P, and K) for assessing their over, under, or balanced use in different regions, and (d) pinpoint the gaps in knowledge for future research needs to optimize the use of N and other nutrients for sustainable crop production and reducing environmental risks. The fertilizer use efficiency indicators considered in this chapter are (i) agronomic efficiency calculated as production of grain over control per unit of applied fertilizer nutrient (Novoa and Loomis, 1981), (ii) improvement in nutrient uptake as measured by apparent recovery efficiency, namely uptake of fertilizer nutrient by plant over control per unit of applied fertilizer nutrient (Dilz, 1988), and (iii) improvement in crop quality parameters such as protein, oil, and fatty acid content. Similarly, water use efficiency (WUE) computed as (i) crop yield m-2 field area m-1 water used and (ii) crop yield m-2 field area m-1 water transpiration or evapotranspiration is considered here. As the impacts can be on a local, regional, or global scale, examples have been cited for different levels. Emphasis is placed on the cereal crops that occupy more than 50% of the harvested area of crop land and contribute more than 75% to annual world food production, but other field crops, such as oilseeds and pulses, vegetables, horticultural crops, and perennials are also discussed. Keeping the practical utility of research in view, a preference has been accorded to results obtained from field experiments over greenhouse and pot culture studies. Â© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

These vaPS cells fundamentally differ from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells in that the latter possess the necessary genetic guidance that makes them intrinsically pluripotent. In contrast, vaPS cells do not have this intrinsic genetic guidance, but are able to differentiate into somatic cells of all three lineages under guidance of the microenvironment they are located in, independent from the original tissue or organ where they had resided. These vaPS cells are of high relevance for clinical application because they are contained in unmodified, autologous, adipose-derived regenerative cells (UA-ADRCs). The latter can be obtained from and re-applied to the same patient at the point of care, without the need for further processing, manipulation, and culturing. These findings as well as various clinical examples presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of UA-ADRCs for enabling an entirely new generation of medicine for the benefit of patients and healthcare systems.

This seemingly conspicuous coloration has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited. In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of other females. We used correlational data and an experimental manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg coloration.

However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.

They can modify the bacterial and parasitic environment of the nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual signalling processes. In spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, green plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored these effects in two different populations, together with the potential effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres. Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of staphylococci on the skin of 8-day-old nestlings was negatively related to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these experimental effects. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This reclamation can provide a novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to 2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis, and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK, between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat) and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e., microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking, prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites. On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age. Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g., nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing bobwhite.

Following establishment, increased resource availability may also facilitate the spread of exotic plant species if it enhances their competitive abilities relative to native species. Exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) introduce both exotic grass seed and nutrients to an endangered plant community on the Gulf Islands of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. I used greenhouse experiments to assess the competitive advantage of the exotic grasses relative to native and exotic forbs in this community and to test the impacts of nutrient addition from goose feces on competitive outcomes. I grew experimental communities varying in their proportion of forbs versus exotic grasses, and added goose feces as a nutrient source. I found that both native and exotic forbs produced significantly more biomass in competition with conspecifics than in competition with the grasses, and that the proportional abundance of two out of three native forbs was lowest in the combined presence of exotic grasses and nutrient addition. In a second experiment, I found that in monoculture all species of forbs and grasses showed equal growth responses to nutrients. The exotic species did not convert additional nutrients into additional biomass at a higher rate, but did germinate earlier and grow larger than the native species regardless of nutrient availability. This suggests that the exotic species may have achieved their competitive advantage partly by pre-empting resources in community mixtures. Small and late-germinating native forbs may be particularly vulnerable to competitive suppression from exotic grasses and forbs and may be at an even greater disadvantage if their competitors are benefiting from early access to additional nutrients. In combination, the input of exotic propagules and additional nutrients by nesting geese may compromise efforts to maintain native community composition in this system.

However, there are limitations with their use related to the availability, immunogenicity, and uncertainty of the mechanisms involved. To address these issues, definitive NSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated using a nonviral, piggyBac transposon approach, were investigated. Committed NSCs were generated from iPS cells using a free-floating neurosphere methodology previously described by our laboratory. To delineate the mechanism of action, specifically the role of exogenous myelination, NSCs derived from wildtype (wt) and nonmyelinating Shiverer (shi) iPS cell lines were used following thoracic SCI with subacute intraspinal transplantation. Behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological outcomes wereanalyzedtoassess the effectivenessof this treatment. Thewt- andshi-iPS-NSCswere validatedand shown to be equivalent except in myelination capacity. Both iPS-NSC lines successfully integrated into the injured spinal cord and predominantly differentiated to oligodendrocytes, but only the wt-iPS-NSC treatment resulted in a functional benefit. The wt-iPS-dNSCs, which exhibited the capacity for remyelination, significantly improved neurobehavioral function (BassoMouse Scale and CatWalk), histological outcomes, and electrophysiological measures of axonal function (sucrose gap analysis) compared with the nonmyelinating iPS-dNSCs and cell-free controls. In summary, we demonstrated that iPS cells can generate translationally relevant NSCs for applications in SCI.

Pieris brassicae, which has been earlier described as unpalatable, was also included in the palatability test. However, there were no significant differences in the palatability of the butterflies to birds, and even P. brassicae was apparently palatable to the great tits.

Three new IVC filters have recently been approved for use in the United States. An in vitro study was performed to compare the risk of engaging and entrapping guide wires in eight of the IVC filters currently available in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium Greenfield, over-the-wire stainless-steel Greenfield, Simon nitinol, Bird's Nest, Vena Tech LGM, Vena Tech LP, TrapEase, and GÃ¼nther Tulip IVC filters were deployed separately in an in vitro IVC flow model. Four different wires (15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped, and straight) were passed 100 times each through the filters (50 from a jugular approach and 50 from a femoral approach). The frequency and specific patterns of engagement of the wires by the filters were recorded. Engagement was defined as a filter/wire interaction that caused either the filter or the wire to be deformed. The second part of the experiment measured the force (in pounds) that was required to release wires that became engaged in the filters with use of an electromechanical test stand with a specially designed low-capacity load cell of 20 pounds. Entrapment was defined as inability to separate an engaged wire from the filter without damage to either the wire or filter. RESULTS: Guide wire engagement occurred in all filters tested with the 15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped wires. The straight wire did not engage any of the filters. The wires engaged the TrapEase filter with the greatest frequency overall (72.8%; 291 of 400). The 15-mm J wire engaged the filters more often than the other wires (98.5%; 788 of 800), but never became entrapped in a filter. The Vena Tech LP and GÃ¼nther Tulip filters did not entrap any of the wires. The TrapEase filter, the stainless-steel Greenfield filter, and the Vena Tech LGM filter entrapped the 3-mm and 1.5-mm J wires. The force required to disengage the wires from these filters exceeded 4 pounds and resulted in structural damage to the wire and/or filter. CONCLUSIONS: Among the IVC filters recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the TrapEase filter entrapped 3-mm and 1.5-mm J-tipped guide wires, whereas the Vena Tech LP and GÃ¼nther Tulip filters did not.

Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects, e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of light at night.",76,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Why some birds add green plants to their nests has long puzzled biologists. Some studies suggest that this behavior is promoted by natural selection because of its positive effects on nestling health. However, if greenery functions as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness, it may promote costly female competition for preferred males. We experimentally increased the amount of plants in spotless starling's nests, causing a reduction in the number of recruits. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses, adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and recruitment success.",16,2,"selected",""

Difficulties in the use of Nest Record Cards for this species (to obtain information from more sites) are discussed. Territory sizes tended to be smaller, and more feeding took place within territories, at Lindisfarne than at Mestersvig. Clutch sizes were similar in different areas. Incubation (mean period about 25 days) was shared fairly equally by the two sexes. Longer incubation shifts at Mestersvig and some areas at Lindisfarne than at other Lindisfarne sites were associated with greater distances between nests and feeding areas. Most egg losses were probably due to predation, and were fewer in the Arctic than in Britain, where nesting success varied greatly in different areas and years, and in relation to timing within a season. Up to five nestings per pair per year were made at Lindisfarne, but only one at Mestersvig. The timing of breeding is discussed, and it is concluded that the date of start of eggâ€�laying in northâ€�east Greenland is determined by the timing of snow clearance, while that at Lindisfarne is related to the decreasing probability of eggâ€�predation later in the season. Because of the high nest losses, the production of young at many temperate sites, including parts of Lindisfarne, was probably inadequate for the population to be selfâ€�supporting. The reasons for the large seasonal, annual and geographical differences are discussed. It is concluded that increasing predation probably determines the southern nesting limits of Ringed plovers, but that this limit may be modified by varying degrees of different types of natural and artificial protection, and extent of habitat suitable for egg camouflage. Increased human usage of nesting beaches probably has an adverse effect on nesting success, but because of the complexity of the number of interâ€�related factors affecting the latter, without field experiments it is difficult to predict how this could best be offset by protection measures.

In this field study on another cavity-nester, tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, we tested whether yarrow reduced ectoparasite loads (the nest protection hypothesis), stimulated nestling immune systems (the drug hypothesis), or had other consequences for nestling growth or parental reproductive success (predicted by both preceding hypotheses). Tree swallows do not naturally add greenery to their nests, and thus offer several advantages in testing for effects of greenery independent of other potentially confounding explanations for the behaviour. We placed fresh yarrow in 23 swallow nests on the day the first egg was laid, replenishing every two days until clutch completion (=three times), and at 44 control nests, nesting material was simply touched. At 12 days of age, we measured nestling body size and mass, and took blood smears to do differential white blood cell counts.

Higher humidity was associated with higher flea numbers whereas number of feathers in the nest was not. Our most significant finding was that an average of 773 fleas Ceratophyllus idius was found in control nests, versus 419 in yarrow nests. Possibly, parents compensate for blood that nestlings lose to ectoparasites by increasing food delivery, because we detected no differences between treatments in nestling mass, nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion of young fledging, or relative to flea numbers.

Although mating with an attractive male may induce females to skew the sex ratio toward males, the balance between the benefits of producing attractive sons and the costs of competing with other females for mates could vary with female age, a possibility that had not been previously explored. In this paper we increment experimentally the attractiveness of males of the polygynous spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) by adding green plants to their nests, a trait involved in courtship, and look for female age-differential effects on offspring primary sex ratio. Young and middle aged females produced more sons in experimental than in control nests, as expected, but old females showed the opposite tendency. To explain this novel result, we speculate that older females are limited to produce the most costly sex because the physiological drawbacks imposed by ageing reduce their ability to compete with younger ones for the non-shareable resources offered by males.

Potential hosts can reduce the cost of parasitism by rejecting foreign eggs from the nest. Observational, comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to identify parasitic eggs (eggâ€“nest contrast hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally test whether eggâ€“nest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two colours: orange and green. Contrary to the eggâ€“nest contrast hypothesis, host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn, experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg rejection rate. Our results demonstrate that eggâ€“nest contrast is a collateral, not a causal factor in egg rejection, and confirm the conclusions of previous studies that hosts can rely on the parasitic eggâ€™s appearance itself to recognize the foreign egg in the nest.

Methods: Four of each type of filter - Simon Nitinol (SN), Bird's Nest (BN), Vena Tech (VT), Greenfield stainless steel (PSGF), Greenfield titanium (TGF), and the investigational stent cone filter (NGF) - were studied for 60 days in 12 sheep. Radiographic and pathologic outcomes to be assessed included clot capture and resolution, vena caval penetration, position of the filter, thrombogenicity, and vessel wall reaction. Results: Filters differed with respect to the number of clot-trapping levels and the interdependence of the legs. All devices were successfully placed. Intentionally embolized clot was captured. One VT and two SN filters migrated in response to clot capture. Resolution of thrombus was variable, and related to the design of the device. Fibrin webbing was widely present with the VT, BN, and SN filters but limited in the others. The VT and NGF filters demonstrated the most stable filter base diameter. Conclusions: The performance of vena caval filters differs with respect to clot resolution and mechanical stability.

Sediment pore water and bulk sediments from several lower Fox River sites were toxic to a number of test species including Pimephales promelas, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Hexagenia limbata, Selenastrum capricornutum, and Photobacterium phosphorum. An important component of the observed toxicity appeared to be due to ammonia. Evaluation of three bullhead (Ictalurus) species from the lower Fox River revealed an absence of preneoplastic or neoplastic liver lesions, and the Salmonella typhimurium bioassay indicated relatively little mutagenicity in sediment extracts. Apparent adverse reproductive effects were noted in two species of birds nesting along the lower Fox River and on a confined disposal facility for sediments near the mouth of the river, and there were measurable concentrations of potentially toxic 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) both in the birds and in sediments from several of the study sites. Based on toxic equivalency factors and the results of an in vitro bioassay with H4IIE rat hepatoma cells, it appeared that the majority of potential toxicity of the PCB/PCDF/PCDD mixture in biota from the lower Fox River/Green Bay system was due to the planar PCBs.

Most people in urban areas spend 80-90\% of their lives indoors, indicating the significance of indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are the most common sources of indoor pollution; their levels can be reduced by using potted plants, which provide the additional benefit of beautification. In accordance with our previous study, for this purpose, we used bird nest fern (Asplenium nidus Linn.), which has a high rate of transpiration and is easy to grow indoors. Upon using 3 treatments involving the release of CO2, HCHO, or CO2 + HCHO, the experimental results showed that bird nest fern can reduce the concentration of CO2 from 2000 ppm to a safe 800 ppm at an average of 1.984 ppm.11(-1) (per pot). By contrast, the concentration of HCHO was reduced from 2 ppm to the safe level of 0.1 ppm, at an average of 0.003 ppm.h(-1) (per pot). Regarding temperature and humidity, the results showed a decrease of 2 degrees C indoors and an increase of 10\% relative humidity.

The present paper describes some experiments on the function of this response, and on the stimuli eliciting it. Carrion Crows and Herring Gulls find white eggs more readily than normal gulls' eggs; it is concluded that the natural colours of the eggs afford a certain degree of cryptic protection. When normal eggs are given an egg shell at 15 cm. distance their vulnerability is greatly increased; this â€œbetrayal effectâ€� decreases rapidly with increased distance between egg and shell. We therefore conclude that egg shell removal helps to protect the brood from predators. As reported by C. BEER (1960) the Black-headed Gull removes a surprisingly wide range of objects from the nest. Large scale tests with egg shell dummies in which colour, shape, size and distance from the nest were varied showed that objects of all colours are carried but that â€œkhakiâ€� (the normal ground colour of the egg) and white are particularly stimulating, while green elicits very few responses. Egg shells elicit more responses than cylindrical rings of the same colour, and these are responded to better than â€œanglesâ€�. Size can be varied within wide limits; very large rings elicit fear which interferes with removal. Various other indications are mentioned which show that the score as obtained in the mass tests does not accurately reflect the responsiveness of the reaction itself but rather the result of its interaction with other behaviour tendencies. The eliciting effect decreases rapidly with increasing distance. On the whole, the gulls' response is very well adapted to its main function of selectively removing the empty shell, but the relatively high scores for objects which have very little resemblance to egg shells suggest that it is adapted to the removal of any object which might make the brood more conspicuous. A pilot test showed that gulls which have incubated black eggs respond better to black egg shell dummies than normal gulls. The lack of promptness of the response as compared with non-colonial waders (Ringed Plover and Oystercatcher) is adaptive, since it tends to reduce predation by other Black-headed Gulls, which are shown to prey selectively on wet chicks. A hitherto unrecognised function of territory is suggested. In a discussion of the entire anti-predator system of the Black-headed Gull its complexity and its compromise character are stressed: the safety demands of the individual clash with those of the brood; there are conflicts between the several safety devices which each benefit the brood; and there are clashes between the ideal safety measures required by each type of predator.",383,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Some myrmecophytic plants, such as the epiphytic orchid Caularthron bilamellatum, actively form hollow structures that provide nesting space for ants (myrmecodomatia), despite a substantial loss of water-storage tissue. This study aimed at assessing the ability of the orchid to take up nitrogen from ant-inhabited domatia as possible trade-off for the sacrifice of potential water storage capacity.MethodsNitrogen uptake capabilities and uptake kinetics of 15N-labelled compounds (NH 4+, urea and l-glutamine) were studied in field-grown Caularthron bilamellatum plants in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Plants were either labelled directly, by injecting substrates into the hollow pseudobulbs or indirectly, by labelling of the associated ants in situ.Key ResultsCaularthron bilamellatum plants were able to take up all tested inorganic and organic nitrogen forms through the inner surface of the pseudobulbs. Uptake of NH4+ and glutamine followed MichaelisMenten kinetics, but urea uptake was not saturable up to 2 mm. 15N-labelled compounds were rapidly translocated and incorporated into vegetative and reproductive structures. By labelling ants with 15N in situ, we were able to prove that ants transfer N to the plants under field conditions.ConclusionsBased on 15N labelling experiments we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that a myrmecophytic orchid is capable of actively acquiring different forms of nitrogen from its domatia and that nutrient flux from ants to plants does indeed occur under natural conditions. This suggests that beyond anti-herbivore protection host plants benefit from ants by taking up nitrogen derived from ant debris. Â© 2012 The Author.",266,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Apple orchards sprayed with pesticides in current use and reference sites were chosen for study in southern Ontario, Canada, during 2000-2001. We assessed thyroid hormone concentrations (plasma and muscle thyroxine [T4], and triiodothyronine [T3]) and the response to a challenge with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as parameters of thyroid histology. Individual nests were exposed to as many as seven individual pesticide applications and up to five pesticide mixtures. Concentrations of p,pâ€²-DDE in eggs from both species were highest in orchard sites, and ranged from 0.05 to 5.44 mg/kg wet weight for tree swallows, and from 0.17 to 95.4 mg/kg for eastern bluebirds. In 2000, tree swallows from sprayed orchards had elevated plasma T4 concentrations, and thyroid glands with collapsed follicles, hypertrophic epithelia, and higher follicular epithelial cells relative to chicks from reference sites. Plasma T4 concentration was positively correlated with the total number of pesticide mixtures applied during egg incubation through chick rearing. In 2001, basal plasma T3 concentration in tree swallow chicks did not differ between orchard and reference sites, though there were differences among orchards; T3 was positively correlated with total number of individual sprays applied during egg incubation through chick rearing. Tree swallows challenged with TSH showed no significant difference in thyroid hormone concentration or follicular epithelial cell height between exposure groups; however, a significantly greater proportion of chicks from reference sites were found to have thyroids with focal or diffuse hypertrophic epithelia relative to orchard chicks. In 2001, bluebirds from sprayed orchards had significantly higher T3 concentrations in response to TSH challenge; this response was positively correlated with the total number of pesticides applied during egg incubation through chick rearing.

Knowledge of their nutrition is important for understanding their survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate husbandry under human care. Hand-rearing is a common practice for psittacines, however research on their nutrition is limited. We analysed the predicted metabolisable energy, crude protein, crude fat, minerals and the essential amino acid profiles of the crop contents from free-living nestlings of scarlet macaws (Ara macao) and red-and-green macaws (Ara chloropterus) from southeastern Peru, Cuban Amazons (Amazona leucocephala bahamensis) from the Bahamas, lilac-crowned Amazons (Amazona finschi) from northwestern Mexico and thick-billed parrots (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) from northern Mexico. The crop content of the different parrot species displayed remarkably similar nutritional profiles, considering their diversity in habitats, geographic ranges and food sources. The crude protein and crude fat concentrations in crop samples were particularly similar for the Ara and Amazona species, while the thick-billed parrot stood out for its higher crude fat and lower crude protein content. Wider variations were found among the concentrations of sodium (Na) and iron (Fe), proline and tryptophan. Compared with the requirements of 6-12 weeks leghorn chickens, all free-ranging parrot diets contained lower crude protein, calcium (Ca), potassium (P) and Na concentrations. The hand-feeding formulas contained lower crude fat, magnesium (Mg), arginine, valine and phenylalanine concentrations, as well as much higher levels of Ca and zinc (Zn), in comparison with parrot crop samples. Our data suggest that a single formulation could be used to hand-rear Ara and Amazona sp. of 3 weeks of age and older, while a different formulation would likely be more appropriated for Rhynchopsitta sp.

Egg recognition in most open-nesting hosts seems to be based entirely on differences in colour. However, hole- and dome-nesting hosts may rely largely on luminance contrasts. Here, we studied egg rejection behaviour in nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos), an open-nesting species that nests in deeply shadowed positions and lays very specific dark olive-green eggs. Although being theoretically suitable as hosts of the cuckoo, nightingales are very rarely parasitized and no cuckoo egg morph mimicking nightingale eggs is known. Thus, we predicted high rejection rate of foreign eggs, but because of the dim nesting environments, luminance contrasts would be an important cue in egg rejection decisions, similar to cavity- or dome-nesting species. We experimentally parasitized nightingale nests with two groups of model egg types: bright eggs and dark eggs. Within each group, one of the egg types was an effective match while the other type was a poor colour match (whitish vs. pale blue and olive-green vs. black).We used a discrimination visual model to quantify host-model egg similarity and compared egg rejection predicted by the model with the observed rejection pattern. Consistent with a scenario of largely luminance-based egg recognition, blue and white eggs, which had larger achromatic mismatching, were rejected at a higher relative rate than the better achromatic matching black and green eggs. Nightingales showed strong aggression to a cuckoo dummy, suggesting that they were involved in coevolutionary interactions with the cuckoo in the past. However, because of the highly distinct appearance of nightingale eggs relative to the other sympatrically breeding passerines, and the largely luminance-based egg recognition, this arms race was likely terminated at an early stage.",107,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

In vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs. Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival. Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link environmental conditions to population productivity and viability.
