Gulls nesting near integrated steel mills showed significantly higher mutation rates than gulls from rural locations (Fisher's exact, P = 0.0004); urban sites without steel mills fell midway between steel and rural sites (difference from rural; Fisher's exact, P = 0.19). Distance of the nesting location of herring gulls from the steel industries' coking ovens was negatively correlated with minisatellite mutation rate demonstrating significant risk for induced germline mutations in cities with steel operations (Kendall Tau; √è‚Äû = 0.119; P < 0.0001).

In this study, we experimentally elevated T levels of monogamous males in the facultatively polygynous European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and compared mate attraction and paternal behaviour of T-treated males with those of controls (C-males). T-males significantly reduced their participation in incubation and fed nestlings significantly less often than C-males. Females paired to T-treated males did not compensate for their mate's lower paternal effort. The observed reduction in a male's investment in incubating the eggs was accompanied by an increased investment in typical female-attracting behaviour: T-males spent a significantly higher proportion of their time singing to attract additional females. They also occupied more additional nestboxes than C-males, although the differences just failed to be significant, and carried significantly more green nesting materials into an additional nestbox (a behaviour previously shown to serve a courtship function). T-males also behaved significantly more aggressively than C-males. During the nestling period, the frequency of mate-attracting behaviours by T-treated and control males no longer differed significantly. Despite the reduced paternal effort by T-males and the lack of compensation behaviour by females, hatching and breeding success did not differ significantly between T- and C-pairs.",167,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Many fundamental features of SVZ migration are still poorly understood, and we addressed several important questions using two-photon time-lapse microscopy of brain slices from postnatal and adult eGFP+ transgenic mice. 1) Longitudinal arrays of neuroblasts, so-called chain migration, have never been dynamically visualized in situ. We found that neuroblasts expressing doublecortin-eGFP (Dcx-eGFP) and glutamic acid decarboxylase-eGFP (Gad-eGFP) remained within arrays, which maintained their shape for many hours, despite the fact that there was a wide variety of movement within arrays. 2) In the dorsal SVZ, neuroblasts migrated rostrocaudally as expected, but migration shifted to dorsoventral orientations throughout ventral regions of the lateral ventricle. 3) Whereas polarized bipolar morphology has been a gold standard for inferring migration in histologic sections, our data indicated that migratory morphology was not predictive of motility. 4) Is there local motility in addition to long distance migration? 5) How fast is SVZ migration? Unexpectedly, one-third of motile neuroblasts moved locally in complex exploratory patterns and at average speeds slower than long distance movement. 6) Finally, we tested, and disproved, the hypothesis that all motile cells in the SVZ express doublecortin, indicating that Dcx is not required for migration of all SVZ cell types. These data show that cell motility in the SVZ and RMS is far more complex then previously thought and involves multiple cell types, behaviors, speeds, and directions. √Ç¬© 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",302,1,"excluded","Out of field"

The speed of disappearance and permanence of these losses depend on a variety of factors, but the pattern of species loss appears more universal. We still do not understand the degree to which different mechanisms lead to population declines and local extinction in fragmented tropical landscapes. We review data currently available to evaluate three of the leading hypotheses, which include altered community dynamics producing mesopredator release and indirect effects of elevated herbivore populations; sensitivity of forest birds to altered microclimatic conditions in fragments, and the constraint of poor dispersal ability that reduces connectivity in fragmented landscapes. We find that all three mechanisms require additional study and suggest steps to be taken in future studies. √Ç¬© 2012 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.",267,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Here, we investigated the potential role that gulls play in the dispersal of plants in Barcelona, a highly populated city of north-eastern Spain. We analysed the stomach contents of 145 chicks collected in urban nests and reported the presence of seeds of 27 plant taxa. We then developed a plant dispersal model based on the movements of 20 GPS-tracked yellow-legged gulls breeding in the city of Barcelona. We estimated seed dispersal distances, seed shadows and percentage of seeds reaching habitats suitable for seeds regurgitated in pellets and those excreted in faeces. Seven of the 27 plant taxa found in the stomachs were alien taxa to Spain. Average dispersal distances of plant seeds by gulls were around 700 m, but maximum dispersal distances reached up to 35 km. Dispersal distances and seed spatial patterns did not differ between faeces and pellet models, as most strongly depended on gull movements. About 95% of the seeds were dispersed within urban environments and between 20 and 30% reached suitable habitats for seed deposition (urban woodlands, green urban parks and urban grasslands). Urban gulls frequently dispersed seeds (including alien species) within urban habitats, both via direct consumption or via secondary dispersal after consuming granivorous birds that had ingested the seeds, such as pigeons or parakeets. Urban planning for Barcelona is based on native plant species, and thus, special attention should be paid to alien plants dispersed by birds, which could pose a risk to native biodiversity in urban ecosystems. √Ç¬© 2022 The Authors",187,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

The colonization process, egg-laying dates, clutch sizes, and fledging success were similar among pairs of P. major nesting in orchards conducted under the three studied management strategies. However, the mean number of young produced per ha (orchard productivity) was significantly higher in organic orchards than in both conventional and IPM orchards. Such divergences between both fledging success and orchard productivity primarily resulted from higher densities of P. major nesting pairs, but also from lower rates of nest abandonment during incubation in organic orchards. We suggest that intensive pesticide use under both IPM and conventional managements may have resulted in a substantial reduction in insect prey availability that enhanced intraspecific competition, which then led to failure in reproduction in pairs with low competitive ability. Our results highlight the relevance of P. major in assessing the environmental impact of apple orchard management strategies. √Ç¬© 2005 SETAC.",310,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Fifteen parrot nest boxes were treated with a permethrin insecticide to push scout bees away and each parrot box was paired with a bee trap box containing a pheromone lure to pull bees. Over a 1-yr period (March 2013 to March 2014), 29 insect colonies moved into 18 of the 35 trap boxes. Nine Africanized honey bee, three native Jatai bee (Tetragonisca sp.), and 17 wasp colonies occupied trap boxes. Only one experimental push-pull pair untreated parrot box was invaded by bees and no parrot boxes in aviaries were colonized. Four of the parrot nest boxes were occupied by birds during our study. Although none were used by Vinaceous-breasted Amazons, Southern House Wrens (Troglodytes musculus), Green-winged Saltators (Saltator similis), and Plain Parakeets (Brotogeris tirica) nested in the boxes and all nests were successful.

There is a complex and species-specific interaction between these plant compounds and their avian seed dispersers. To determine whether two important secondary metabolites in wine grapes - tannins and colour pigments - might be important cues to two of the avian species that forage on wine grapes, and how species-specific this interaction might be, comparative field experiments were run with Australasian silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) and European blackbirds (Turdus merula). Both species were offered a glucose/fructose artificial nectar with increasing concentrations of grape tannins. In a second experiment, they were offered both green and purple artificial grapes where only the colour differed. Both species showed aversion to tannins; silvereyes appeared to have greater tolerance than blackbirds of tannin concentrations above 5%. In summer no preference was shown between green and purple coloured artificial grapes, but in late autumn blackbirds took only purple grapes whereas silvereyes pecked mostly at green. Links between tannin for seed protection and colour signals to birds are discussed.

Since 1980 research on the Gyrfalcon in the western Palearctic has increased greatly, especially in Iceland (O K Nielsen), Norway (P J Tommeraas and associates), Sweden (U Falkdalen and associates in Projekt Jaktfalk), and Finland (P Koskimies). Much new work has also been accomplished in the Nearctic, but unfortunately fresh data from Greenland and Russia lag far behind. The main recent findings and interpretations follow: field characters have been clarified to emphasize differences in appearance and flight behaviour between Gyrfalcons and other similar species. In most parts of the range, habitat associations are closely tied to the occurrence of Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopus and Ptarmigan L. mutus, the chief prey species of this predominantly resident arctic raptor. Its overall distribution has not changed significantly in the 20th century. Much new information on Gyrfalcon populations, especially in Iceland and Fennoscandia, indicates that although, in many parts of the range, breeding pairs fluctuate markedly in number in 4- or 10-year cycles-or sometimes irregularly-there has been little long-term change in overall population size in the last >50 years; however, there is evidence from Lapland that breeding density was much reduced around the turn of the last century, probably owing mainly to habitat changes and consequent reduction in Lagopus populations, secondarily to human persecution. Conservation should emphasize habitat restoration for grouse and other prey species, preservation of traditional eyries, and protection from human disturbance and persecution. Most Gyrfalcons specialize on Lagopus spp. for food summer and winter (60-90% of diet), but some, especially in the high Arctic, specialize on other prey such as Little Auks Alle alle, lemmings Lemmus and Dicrostonyx, and Arctic Hare Lepus arcticus. Gyrfalcons show both functional and numerical responses to changes in grouse density. Gyrfalcons more often use the stick nest of Ravens Corvus corax on cliffs or trees than any other nesting sites; tree-nesting Gyrfalcons in the Russian Arctic have been reported to refurbish old stick nests of other species for their own use. Breeding success depends more on spring weather than on food supply. Survival statistics are still meagre, and much research is needed. Body mass (weight) normally varies in individuals by as much as 250-500 g depending on sex and state of nutrition; males usually fall between 1000 and 1400 g, females between 1250 and 2000 g. The term 'morph' has been incorrectly applied to the Gyrfalcon's continuous variation in plumage from the whitest to darkest individuals. DNA and cross-breeding experiments show that the Gyrfalcon is most closely related to the Saker Falco cherrug and likely conspecific with it.",334,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

To test how the changing properties of developing GCs affect spiking behavior, we examined synaptic responses of mature and immature GCs in hippocampal slices from adult mice. Whereas synaptic inhibition restricted GC spiking at most stages of maturation, the relative influence of inhibition, excitatory synaptic drive, and intrinsic excitability shifted over the course of maturation. Mature GCs received profuse afferent innervation such that spiking was suppressed primarily by inhibition, whereas immature GC spiking was also limited by the strength of excitatory drive. Although the input resistance was a reliable indicator of maturation, it did not determine spiking probability at immature stages. Our results confirm the existence of a transient period during GC maturation when perforant path stimulation can generate a high probability of spiking, but also reveal that immature GC excitability is tempered by functional synaptic inhibition and reduced excitatory innervation, likely maintaining the sparse population activity observed in vivo. √Ç¬© 2013 the authors.",259,1,"excluded","Out of field"

Internal dispersal was investigated by searching for seeds in faeces opportunistically collected at communal roosts, foraging sites and nests of eleven parrot species in different habitats and biomes in the Neotropics. Multiple intact seeds of seven plant species of five families were found in a variable proportion of faeces from four parrot species. The mean number of seeds of each plant species per dropping ranged between one and about sixty, with a maximum of almost five hundred seeds from the cacti Pilosacereus pachydadus in a single dropping of Lear's Macaw (Anodorhynchus leari). All seeds retrieved were small (<3 mm) and corresponded to herbs and relatively large, multiple-seeded fleshy berries and infrutescences from shrubs, trees and columnar cacti, often also dispersed by stornatochory. An overview of the potential constraints driving seed dispersal suggest that, despite the obvious size difference between seeds dispersed by endozoochory and stornatochory, there is no clear difference in fruit size depending on the dispersal mode. Regardless of the enhanced or limited germination capability after gut transit, a relatively large proportion of cacti seeds frequently found in the faeces of two parrot species were viable according to the tetrazolium test and germination experiments. The conservative results of our exploratory sampling and a literature review clearly indicate that the importance of parrots as endozoochorous dispersers has been largely under-appreciated due to the lack of research systematically searching for seeds in their faeces.

However, the importance of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in these adaptations are seldom studied. In birds, temperature could affect egg characteristics. Higher temperatures during egg-laying may reduce maintenance costs for females and allow a higher investment in reproduction. Yet, females may also use temperatures as a cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by approximately 1 √Ç¬∞C throughout the entire laying period in great tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen), eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier. Lysozyme concentration decrease with the laying sequence in late clutches only. Thus, effects of temperature may also change with the laying sequence and it would be interesting in the future to tests the effects on first-laid eggs. √Ç¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",210,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Neonatal character states are typically transformed, reduced, or eliminated during the first 10\% of their prereproductive development. Traditionally, neonates have not been distinguished from juvenile reptiles. As a result the neonatology of reptiles has rarely been addressed in past literature. Recent studies reveal a complex array of developmental scenarios involving character state transformations, heterochrony, unique character states in morphology, behavior, physiology, nutrition, dispersion and health. Unique morphological features (such as egg teeth) and limited skeletal ossification characterize many neonates. Distinguishing behaviors include ``reversal{''} movements, utilization of bright color patterns, and startling movements with both serving as anti-predation mechanisms. Prolonged association with protective parents, group migration, unique agonistic behavior, and tendencies toward rapid dispersion characterize the neonates of individual species. Neonatal physiological attributes include: a special availability to inoculation by symbiont fermenting anaerobes in herbivores, rapid conforming responses to their external environments in thermal and hydric exchanges, and in the case of some turtles, extraordinary capacities for supercooling (8.9 C). Post-paritive lecithotrophy (nutrition from residual yolk) sustain both the ovenwintering of nestlings and the dispersion of nonfeeding young for as long as several months.

We investigated the behavioral and physiological responses of male European starlings to the sequential addition of nest boxes and nesting material, green herbs, and female conspecifics and how these responses depend on the availability of certain antioxidants (anthocyanins) in the diet. As expected, cloacal protuberance volume and plasma testosterone of males generally increased with photoperiod. More notably, testosterone levels peaked in males fed the high antioxidant diet when both nest box and herbal cues were present, while males fed the low antioxidant diet showed no or only a muted testosterone response to the sequential addition of these environmental cues; thus our results are in agreement with the oxidation handicap hypothesis. Males fed the high antioxidant diet maintained a constant frequency of breeding behaviors over time, whereas those fed the low antioxidant diet decreased breeding behaviors as environmental cues were sequentially added. Overall, sequential addition of the environmental cues modulated physiological and behavioral measures of reproductive condition, and dietary antioxidants were shown to be a key factor in affecting the degree of response to each of these cues. Our results highlight the importance of supplementary environmental cues and key resources such as dietary antioxidants in enhancing breeding condition of males, which conceivably aid in attraction of high quality females and reproductive success. √Ç¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",214,1,"selected",NA

Forest certification programs require participants to have biodiversity management programs in place supported by up-to-date science and, in some cases, to have guidelines for retention of important stand-level habitat features important to wildlife. To meet this information need, we reviewed the scientific literature for information on relationships between stand-level habitat features and wildlife communities. Within this report, we give definitions and general characteristics of habitat features considered particularly important to wildlife management in southern forests. Because of the prominence of pine plantation management in the southern U.S., particular attention is paid to research performed in southern pine systems. We follow with a comprehensive examination of wildlife relationships to each habitat feature and an analysis of information gaps and research needs. We selected five habitat features for review: coarse woody debris (CWD), snags, den trees, isolated wetlands, and streamside management zones (SMZs). These features have demonstrated potential for impacting diversity, though their contributions in pine systems are not always well-documented. There were indications of other features with potential impact (e.g., fork-topped pines, roads), but there was as yet little evidence of their importance. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is used by a great number of wildlife species; however, few manipulative experiments have been performed in southern pines to determine whether this use is obligatory or facultative. While some species have shown responsiveness to CWD, benefits supplied by pine litter may substantially overlap those supplied by CWD in other forest types. Snags increase wildlife species diversity and richness by providing nesting and roosting sites for cavity-nesting species and foraging sites for insectivores. The effects of snag density are generally well-documented, at least for avian communities; however, the impact of snag distribution on communities of snag-dependent wildlife, both within stands and across the landscape, has not been adequately investigated. Den trees are mostly confined to hardwood species, and can contribute multiple habitat values such as mast and vertical structure. Den users are often highly selective, and may take into account features of the den itself, the immediate habitat, or the surrounding landscape. Den tree research in pine-dominated landscapes is almost completely lacking, and study of den trees in SMZs and retention patches could provide much-needed information regarding optimum density, juxtaposition, and distribution. Isolated wetlands, while individually managed at the stand level, involve definite landscape-scale considerations as well. Species associated with isolated wetlands may spend most of their life cycle in adjacent uplands, requiring knowledgeable management of both wetland and upland to insure their contribution to biodiversity. The impacts of silvicultural practices on communities associated with isolated wetlands are not well known, and most of the research conducted in pine systems is of limited scope. Long-term manipulative experiments, complete with pre-treatment data and adequate replication, are critical to understanding the disturbance regimes to which wildlife communities associated with isolated wetlands in different regions are best suited. Streamside management zones also involve both stand- and landscape-scale consideration. Because they contain a heterogeneous mix of habitat elements not always found in pine plantations, SMZs have the potential to greatly increase biodiversity in pine-dominated landscapes, to provide refuges for disturbance sensitive species, and to serve as population sources for recolonization of disturbed sites. Studies regarding the impact of SMZ width in pine-dominated landscapes have produced inconsistent and even conflicting results, and it seems unlikely that a single recommended width will suffice for all situations. Management of sites adjacent to SMZs may have as much or greater impact than SMZ width. We suggest research goals and methodology to address information gaps and research directions in southern pine forests. Long-term manipulative experiments are encouraged both to increase the power of researchers to test hypotheses and to account for long-term variation in wildlife populations. Wildlife responses to habitat manipulations should be measured using demographic characteristics rather than density alone. Statistical methods such as multivariate analyses should be brought to bear on questions of community ecology and response to habitat characteristics. Studies performed in natural pine and pine-hardwood forests can provide baseline material for comparisons with managed pines. There also is a need to improve knowledge of the impact of silvicultural actions, including herbicide use, on the dynamics of snags and CWD, and to develop reliable landscape-scale models to predict the results of management on stand-level habitat features. √Ç¬© 2008 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.",292,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

We added green plants to a group of experimental nests (E nests) and quantified the activity of the nesting females in the E nests and in a group of non-manipulated nests (C nests). The females never added green plants to their nests, but they removed the green plants more frequently from the E nests than from the C nests. The number of departures from the nest by females that carried green plants was positively correlated with the number of visits by females that carried nothing. In contrast, the number of departures by females carrying green plants was uncorrelated with the number of visits made by females that carried nest-building materials. These results suggest that the females made a specific additional effort to remove the green plants from the E nests. We propose that this behaviour may be an adaptive response of mated females that serves to counteract the eventual negative effects of green plants on their reproductive success.

This seemingly conspicuous coloration has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited. In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of other females. We used correlational data and an experimental manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg coloration.

We assessed the costs and benefits of asynchronous hatching in the Greenrumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), a small Neotropical parrot that hatches large clutches very asynchronously. We manipulated eggs to create broods of four, six, or eight young that hatched synchronously or asynchronously. In a second experiment, we tested whether food limits offspring survival by experimentally feeding later hatched young in large asynchronous broods. We also examined the premise that food varies unpredictably by sampling seeds throughout several breeding seasons. Experimentally synchronized broods generally fledged as many or more young than asynchronous broods. Synchrony particularly outperformed asynchrony in broods of eight, where food demands should have been greatest. Nestlings had a higher probability of hedging from synchronous broods than from asynchronous broods, from small rather than medium or large broods, and if they were early hatched rather than later hatched. Most mortality in asynchronous broods occurred within 12 d of hatching, and a significantly greater proportion of later hatched chicks died with empty crops than did early hatched chicks. Later hatched chicks grew more slowly than their earlier hatched nestmates, but at fledging they were as heavy or heavier than earlier hatched chicks. Chicks from asynchronous broods were slightly heavier at hedging than synchronous chicks, but there was no correlation between hedging mass and the likelihood of being resighted in subsequent years. Cormack-Jolly-Seber model estimates revealed no significant differences in annual survival rates between young fledged from synchronous and asynchronous broods. Female chicks hedged from synchronous broods were recruited into the study population at a lower rate than those from asynchronous broods. Older chicks from reduced broods were less likely to hedge than chicks from broods that fledged all their young. Parents of large synchronous and asynchronous broods provisioned their young at similar rates and did not differ significantly in their subsequent survival. Females that raised experimentally synchronous and asynchronous broods showed no significant differences in the likelihood, timing, or success of their next breeding attempt. A marginally higher proportion of last-hatched chicks that received supplemental food survived to fledging than last-hatched control chicks, but feeding had no effect on penultimate chicks. Seed densities showed a high degree of autocorrelation over spans of 30-50 d. Asynchronous hatching appears to result in the mortality of the smallest young, due in part to the inequitable distribution of food among nestmates, rather than to food limitation, and as a direct result of the size disparities among nestmates. Thus, parrotlet parents appeared to derive no detectable short- or long-term benefits from the staggered hatching of their young through increased nestling growth and survival, reduced parental efforts, or increased parental survival. Although other adaptive benefits from hatching asynchrony are possible that were not tested directly in these experiments (e.g., `'insurance'' that some nestlings will survive), they seem insufficient to account for the extreme hatching asynchrony observed in the parrotlet. Instead, benefits to egg survival derived from the early onset of incubation may offset the costs of asynchronous hatching.",39,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Six groups of six males and six females were separated into six free-flight breeding aviaries. Nestboxes and nesting material were freely available throughout the experiment.

Symmetrically banded males produced more offspring that survived past the period of parental care than males in either of the asymmetric treatments; this appeared to be the effect of female choice processes and female-based parental investment and not male intra-sexual dominance. This is the first experiment to indicate that symmetrically manipulated males gain reproductive advantages in controlled laboratory conditions and further supports recent theories indicating the evolutionary importance of symmetry in signalling-trait design.

The crop content of the different parrot species displayed remarkably similar nutritional profiles, considering their diversity in habitats, geographic ranges and food sources. The crude protein and crude fat concentrations in crop samples were particularly similar for the Ara and Amazona species, while the thick-billed parrot stood out for its higher crude fat and lower crude protein content. Wider variations were found among the concentrations of sodium (Na) and iron (Fe), proline and tryptophan.

We conducted a landscape-scale controlled experiment to assess the short-term effects of herbicide and seeding on the reproduction of an obligate grassland bird, the dickcissel (Spiza americana). In 2014, four sites in southern Iowa were each subdivided into three patches (mean 7Â ha). One patch in each site was treated with glyphosate herbicide (spray-only), one with herbicide and native seeding (spray-and-seed), with the third serving as a control. Two sites were grazed by cattle from April to July and two sites were ungrazed. We monitored dickcissel reproduction in 2016, finding that they were more abundant, built more nests, experienced less cowbird parasitism, had increased nest survival, and produced more fledglings on spray-only and spray-and-seed treatments compared to control patches. Dickcissels nested infrequently on grazed sitesâ€”especially grazed control patches. We did not detect any impacts on clutch size, provisioning rates, or nestling mass, but Araneae (spiders) and Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars) may have been smaller on sprayed patches. Positive responses by dickcissels were likely due to successful reduction of tall fescue and improved access to suitable nest sites through increased vegetation heterogeneity.

Interphyletic comparisons in mammals suggest that male-biased dispersal occurs in polygynous and promiscuous species where local mate competition among males exceeds local resource competition among females. However, few studies have analysed sex-biased patterns of dispersal at the individual level, and facultatively polygynous species might offer this opportunity. In the spotless starling, polygynous males exhibit their mating status during courtship carrying higher amounts of green plants to nests than monogamous males. We experimentally incorporated green plants to nests during four years to analyse long-term consequences on breeding success and offspring recruitment rates. We unexpectedly found that experimental sons recruited farther than experimental daughters, while control daughters recruited farther than control sons. A similar pattern was found using observational information from eight years. We discuss this result in the context of local competition hypothesis and speculate that sons dispersed farther from nests controlled by polygynous males to avoid competition with relatives. The amount of green plants in nests affects female perception of male attractiveness and degree of polygyny, although little is known about proximate mechanisms linking this process with the offspring dispersal behaviour. Our results support the idea that male-biased dispersal is related to polygyny in a facultatively polygynous bird. Â© 2016 The Authors",70,2,"selected",NA

Breeding populations of birds in these remote locations may be changing and have garnered much attention regarding their conservation. We analyzed data from bird lists (daily species observations) collected while conducting other targeted research to estimate trends in the probability of observing species at two sub-Arctic study sites. For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species) we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60% of species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional, provincial and national. We hypothesized that trends may be due to climate change effects or because of effects related to intensive herbivory from nesting geese. Trends for most of the species where we made specific predictions from these hypotheses agreed with those predicted; however, well-designed experiments are needed to conclusively determine the driving mechanisms of these trends. Collecting bird list data while simultaneously conducting other research is not nearly as time consuming or expensive as targeted breeding bird surveys (e.g., point counts, call counts, nest searching, etc.). This analysis method may be of utility for other remote field study sites where gaps in trend data exist. Â© 2021 by the author(s).

The chimpanzees of the Goualougo Triangle are known to have one of the largest and most complex tool repertoires reported for wild chimpanzees. One tool set habitually used by this population includes a perforating tool to penetrate the hard outer crust of elevated termite nests before fishing for termite prey with an herbaceous stem. Here, we report the variation present in the grips used on the perforating tool. Our analysis of video recordings of chimpanzee visitation to termite nests over a 3-year period shows that these chimpanzees use a variety of grips to navigate the challenges encountered in opening a termite nest. For situations in which the soil is most hardened, perforating requires force and a power grip is often used. When the soil in the passageway is loose, precision grips are suitable for the task. One of the preferred grips reported here is an interdigital brace, which has previously been described in studies of how some people hold a pencil. In this study, for the first time, the interdigital brace has been thoroughly described for chimpanzees. The various strategies and grips used during perforation emphasize the importance of termites as a nutritional resource that should be considered more strongly as a food used by early hominins.

It was the summer in 1965 while conducting my doctoral dissertation research at the University of Georgia (UGA). My dissertation research was the first major investigation conducted at HorseShoe Bend (HSB) Experimental Site located in Clarke County, latitude 33Â°57â€_N and longitude 83Â°23â€_W, near Athens, Georgia. HSB is a 35-acre (14.1-ha) research site created by a meander of the North Oconee River (see Barrett 1968, Blesh and Williams 2003, Hendrix 1997 for detailed descriptions of the site). This ecosystem-level investigation focused on the effects of a carbamate insecticide (Sevin) on small mammal populations in semi-enclosed grassland ecosystems later published in Ecology (Barrett 1968). At HSB, the undergrowth outside of the 0.4-ha enclosures and along the North Oconee River contained an abundance of Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), and greenbrier (Smilax sp.) within a bottomland forest community. One afternoon during the 1960s, while hiking through this mixed hardwood and thicket-type plant community, I came upon a globular nest. I had never seen a nest like this during my childhood while living on a farm in southern Indiana. I assumed it was a bird nest of which I was not yet familiar. Out of curiosity, I touched the nest with a stick and out from the nest appeared the most beautiful small mammal that I had ever observed. This docile animal stopped on a limb in the sun to groom. Its rich golden pelage remains vivid in my mind to this day. I returned to the nest site the next day with a pair of long forceps to live capture (by its tail) and identify this beautiful small mammal species. I found it interesting to observe a small mammal residing in bushes, rather than in open fields, such as the deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that I had livetrapped in a red clover (Trifolium pratense) field while conducting research for my Master's thesis at Marquette University (Barrett and Darnell 1967). This individual was identified as a golden mouse and that experience, unrelated to my dissertation research at the time, was my initial introduction to O. nuttalli. It was also at that time that I read an article in the March-April issue of Audubon Magazine entitled Search for the Golden Mouse (Terres 1966), which intrigued me. These circumstances served as an early incentive for a continuing interest that would result many years later in this book.

In particular, sex-biased predation is expected to have implications for sexual selection, sex allocation and population dynamics. In this study, we analysed sex differences in the predation of the western green lizard (Lacerta bilineata) by the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) during the reproductive season. In addition, we investigated whether the rate of predation differed during the 8-year study period and among the three habitats studied. We collected lizard remains from nest boxes of kestrels. Freshly killed lizards were sexed by visual inspection, whilst the sex of head remains was assigned by analysing the cephalic scale morphology using geometric morphometrics. Our results show that the risk of being predated by a kestrel in our population was overall about 3.55 times higher for males than for females. To our knowledge this is the first study showing a male-biased predation in a lizard species. The selective predation of males was consistent between years over the 8-year study period (1999-2006) and also consistent between the three types of kestrel hunting habitat. Overall predation rates on lizards differed between habitats, depending on the year. We propose that the observed sex-biased predation is mainly due to sex differences in lizard behaviour.

The natural living-space of wildlife is shrinking due to human activities. 70% of the hunting areas are cultivated today. The majority of wild animals is squeezed into the plough-lands, where they are threatened not only by harvesters and mowers, but also by the adverse effects of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. The experiment was aimed at modelling the effects of NIKROL - UAN solution on chick embryos. In alfalfa-fields different solutions of NIKROL are used for manuring: concentrated solution for basic fertilization, 50% solution for mulching and 20% solution for foliar fertilization. The time of foliar fertilization coincides with the egg-laying and hatching period of pheasants and partridges, thus endangering the reproductive success of these species. In the experiment the effects of different NIKROL - UAN solutions (concentrated, 50%, 20%, 1%) on embryonic development were determined. Main results: Concentrated, 50% and 20% solutions of NIKROL injected into the eggs caused 87-96% embryonic mortality right after treatment. Embryomortality slightly decreased (27-80%) when eggs,.were immersed in the solutions, but still was dose-dependent. 29 different morphological deformities were detected of which the most frequent ones were stunted growth (16%) and cyst over the embryo (14%). Statistical analysis showed that in the second 5 days of incubation NICROL did not influence the weight gain of living embryos when eggs were immersed in the solutions. NIKROL - UAN solution proved to be dangerous to small games nestling in alfalfa- and winter-cereal fields. This fact calls for the extention of research on the postembryonic development of birds, and other animal species (deer, rabbit, etc.). Neglecting fertilization is inconceivable these days, but the application of fertilizers should be carried out with circumspection. In order to protect birds foliar fertilization should be completed at a time not coinciding with the egg-laying and hatching period. The protection of other animal species accounts for the reduction of the amount of fertilizer applied.

Distinct subcolony groups were recognized within the colony. During incubation, attendance at the colony increased to a peak between 2100 and 2400 h, with large rafts building up on the sea before engaging in aerial flights and then settling on land. During the nestling period, this pattern changed with further peaks at 0600 and 1800 h, and a decline during the afternoon, particularly during the late nestling period. Little Auks fed exclusively on copepods and amphipods (94%Calanus finmarchicus) usually captured within 2.5 km of the colony. Feeding rhythms fitted closely the known diurnal vertical migrations of Calanus with peaks between 2200 and 0800 h. Some individuals within subcolony groups showed synchrony of feeds, mainly between 1800 and 2400 h. The mean number of feeds to a chick in 24 h was 5.25. Growth rates of young were comparable between all four experimental groups and controls, although the latter attained higher weights. Mean daily weight increases were constant until 18 days of age when they declined sharply. This was not reflected in a change in mean daily weight increases with date and so suggests that food availability had not declined. Instead there was a reduced feeding rate to chicks from age 21 days to fledging. Breeding success was 50 %, mainly the result of egg desertion and predation by Arctic Foxes, and this may have been reduced by our own activities. Behaviour postures and the responses they elicited are described together with the diurnal patterns of different activities. Aerial flights are also described and their possible function discussed. It is concluded that the shortness of the time when abundant food is available has encouraged close breeding synchrony and this is achieved by mass flights and rafting on the sea beside the colony, and subdivision of the colony into groups with communal behaviour close to the nests.

In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants in blue tit nests affect physiological condition of nestlings as indicated by hemoglobin and glucose in the blood. Nestlings in nests supplemented with fresh, aromatic plants had elevated blood hemoglobin, and therefore improved physiological condition, as compared with control nestlings. There was no difference between nestlings in two contrasting habitats (urban parkland and forest). Although mean levels of blood glucose did not differ between treatment and control nestlings, the blood of forest nestlings contained more glucose than the blood of parkland nestlings, which indicates poorer health for forest nestlings. In general, knowledge of the effects of incorporating fresh green, aromatic plant material into avian nests on physiological condition of nestlings is still fragmentary and more experimental studies are needed. Significance statement: The blue tit is one of a few known passerine birds that incorporate fresh fragments of aromatic plants in their nest during the nesting period. Little is known about the impact of this material on nestling body condition, and there is a need to understand this behavior and its effects.

We evaluated how brood size influenced nestling physiological (glucocorticoids) and somatic traits (growth), and the extent to which their relationship differed between two closely related, sympatric songbirds when experiencing identical rearing environments. Specifically, we used a cross-fostering approach to alter brood size and create an experimental gradient of nestmate competition, and then tested whether experimentally manipulated brood sizes resulted in nestlings with altered concentrations of corticosterone and whether corticosterone responses traded off with growth. Nestlings of both species experienced elevated concentrations of baseline and stressor-induced corticosterone when raised in enlarged broods, relative to control and reduced broods, but neither measurement was found to trade off with growth or be linked to survival to fledging. In contrast, we found divergence in the magnitude of the corticosterone stress response between species across all brood treatments, with greater stressor-induced corticosterone concentrations found in the Violet-green Swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) relative to the closely related Tree Swallow (T.√Ç¬†bicolor). Our study demonstrated that brood size can lead to changes in offspring corticosterone concentrations in swallows and that nestlings of sympatric species, even those that are closely related and ecologically similar, can diverge in their corticosterone stress response when experiencing identical rearing conditions. We conclude that corticosterone appears to play a key role for balancing energetic demands that arise in the face of nestmate competition in Tachycineta swallows and that elevated concentrations of corticosterone may enhance offspring survival during challenging environmental conditions, such as when brood competition is strong.

Fungal endophytes'fungi that live asymptomatically within plant tissues'are a pervasive group of symbionts well known for their role in mediating host-responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, they also may become pathogenic and often impose metabolic costs on hosts. Here, we examine the role of fungal endophytes in mediating responses of the host grass red fescue (Festuca rubra) to salt and herbivore stress. We collected 38 red fescue genotypes from within its native range on Akimiski Island, Nunavut, Canada, where it occurs in the supratidal region on the northern part of the island and is heavily grazed by nesting and brood-rearing snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis). We screened all plants for the presence of the systemic endophyte Epichlo√É¬´ festucae and sequenced the nonsystemic endophytic community on a subset of these plants. While we did not detect E. festucae, our plants instead were host to a diverse array of nonsystemic fungal endophytes. We then conducted a fully factorial greenhouse experiment where we crossed plant genotype (4 levels) with simulated grazing (clipped or unclipped), endophyte status (present or absent) and salinity (0, 32 or 64 ppt) to examine the ecological role of this endophytic community. Overall, the presence of nonsystemic endophytes increased plant survival, but only in the absence of salt or clipping. On the other hand, these endophytes reduced plant tolerance to simulated herbivory by 69% but had no effect on aboveground plant growth. Thus, our results identify a potential nonsystemic endophyte-mediated trade-offin host plant survival and tolerance to herbivory and suggest this trade-offmay be altered by stressful abiotic conditions. √Ç¬© 2016 Santangelo and Kotanen.",13,2,"excluded","Not birds"

A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals and across contexts.

Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.",15,1,"excluded","duplicate"

Why some birds add green plants to their nests has long puzzled biologists. Some studies suggest that this behavior is promoted by natural selection because of its positive effects on nestling health. However, if greenery functions as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness, it may promote costly female competition for preferred males. We experimentally increased the amount of plants in spotless starling's nests, causing a reduction in the number of recruits. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses, adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and recruitment success.",16,2,"selected",NA

The incubation temperature is higher in nests with herbs than in herbless nests. Females are attracted by herb nests and herb nests provide energy-saving benefits to incubating females. In choice experiments, starlings employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can only discriminate odours during the reproductive season.

The feed mixtures (Starter and Grower/Finisher types) were made of corn and extracted soy meal and they also contained fodder yeast, soy oil, mineral additives, premixes (with an addition of growth promoters or without) and an addition of dried green forage or dried herbs. The mechanical properties of the bones were determined on the basis of the three-point bend test performed with the use of an Instron 4302 apparatus coupled with a computer. The test registers as a graph the dependence between the force acting perpendicularly to the long axis of the bone and its deformation. An examination was performed to determine maximum force, and the maximum elasticity force. The studies revealed that both the type and the amount of the herbs determined chickens' growth and the physical and strength properties of their bones. The most beneficial effects were observed in feeding birds mixtures containing 1\% of pansy, since the values noted for all traits and indices were not worse than the effects obtained in the control group receiving antibiotic growth promoter, and in some cases they were even higher.

Spotless starling males (Sturnus unicolor) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male-biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female-female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male-biased sex ratios and female resource-holding potential in intra-sexual competition in this species. √Ç¬© 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",286,2,"selected",NA

More than half of all Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus occurred in the absence of Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis during nesting and post-hatching periods compared to c. 20\% when concentrated by pre-breeding snow cover. In contrast, only 5\% of Barnacle Geese were observed in the absence of Pink-footed Geese pre-breeding, 15\% during nesting, and 35\% post-hatching. Among six defined habitat types, Barnacle Geese resorted more to `upland' habitats during pre-breeding and nesting and to lowland lakes post-hatching when compared to Pink-footed Geese. Although Pink-footed Geese showed less change in seasonal habitat preference, many shifted to the river valley bottom post-hatching, giving access to open water (predator avoidance) and lush green vegetation (foraging for goslings). The smallest extent of distributional overlap between the two species occurred post-hatching, but each species was also highly restricted by snow cover during pre-nesting. The greatest extent of overlap in distribution and diet occurred during incubation, when large dietary variation between different breeding valleys reflected local food availability around nests (probably a result of nest-site preference rather than food selection per se). Whether this means that increased interactions within and between the two goose species with future increases in local density are most likely to be manifest at this stage of the summer is impossible to determine without knowledge of available food resources and manipulative experiments.

Single overall sprays applied between 200 and 250 accumulated day degrees (above a base air temperature of 3degreesC; degreesCd) and band applied treatments applied at 10\% or 20\% ground cover within the crop rows generally gave significantly greater weed biomass and seed rain than conventional treatments, while later band sprays (more than 650degreesCd) reduced seed return.

However, the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of rare species are seldom examined and are poorly understood. I tested several explanations of landscape-scale rarity in the New England cobble beach plant community, an assemblage of halophytic forbs associated with fringing beds of the marine intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora. Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the cobble substrate, thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species. Frequencies of the presence of forb species behind 387 sampled Spartina beds distributed along 120 km of shoreline in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, ranged from 0.005 to 0.382. Both the whole forb assemblage and individual species were strongly nested with respect to patch size and species richness. Species that were rare on a landscape scale were generally only found behind the longest beds, and bed length was positively related to species diversity. Experimental seed additions to 40 beds ranging in length from 8 to 688 m indicated that intermediate-sized beds often occupied by common species are not habitable by three rare forbs. When present behind the longest beds, these rare species are always associated with a microhabitat characterized by a relatively fine-grained and highly stable substrate. A series of substrate manipulations combined with experimental seed additions indicated that the rare annuals Spergularia marina, Salicornia biglovii, and Atriplex arenaria are restricted to the longest Spartina beds because smaller beds lack suitable substrate. These experiments also suggest that seed supply, competitors, and herbivores are not the proximate causes of the absence of these species from smaller beds, although dispersal limitation may prevent the colonization of many larger habitable patches. The microhabitat required by the rare forbs appears to be generated by the deposition of fine-grained particles behind the center of the longest Spartina beds. Consequently, bed length is causally related to the distribution of populations at a landscape scale and to species richness and composition at the scale of a whole habitat patch.",33,2,"excluded","Not birds"

Species-rich canopies (five or more species) in the reference marsh were taller and had more (13 vs. 7) layers than monotypes of Salicornia virginica, although both had 100% cover. Cover and layering were greater for three- and six-species plots than for one-species plots in both the field experiment (70 2 x 2 m plots, eight herbaceous halophytes) and greenhouse (same treatments). Cover (80-95%) and heights were similar among field experimental treatments after two growing seasons (18 mo after planting seedlings in April 1997). In years 3-4, heights (√¢ÀÜ¬º0.5 m) and cover (√¢ÀÜ¬º100%) were similar to those of the 1998 reference marsh data, but only 1-3 canopy layers had developed. Species effects became evident when assemblages were replicated in the greenhouse. The eight one-species treatments differed in cover, height, and layering, and complementary traits produced more layers in multispecies canopies than monotypes. Within the three- and six-species canopies, attributes were similar for most assemblages, but there was a slight height effect with S. virginica, as in the field. In general, the effects of individual species were best distinguished by heights, and species-richness effects by layering. Of relevance to the larger diversity debate is our finding that the attribute examined influenced perceptions of the importance of species number vs. species composition. To apply our results, managers would assess height and layering, not just vegetation cover. Salt marsh restorationists would establish species-rich assemblages in newly graded sites to accelerate the development of canopy height and layering. Monitoring efforts would continue until canopy architecture matches that of reference systems (>4 yr for Californian marshes planted on coarse, nutrient-poor soils).

Here I analyze the egg appearance of an East African weaverbird species that has variable eggs and is a host of brood parasitism by an egg-mimicking cuckoo, in order to (1) compare population variation to variation within a clutch as a measure of the distinctiveness of eggs; (2) assess modularity versus correlation among egg appearance traits as an indication of the complexity of egg signatures; and (3) address whether the eggs are discretely polymorphic or continuously variable in appearance. I also compare three methods of assessing egg coloration: reduction of spectral data to orthogonal components, targeted spectral shape variables, and avian visual modeling. Then I report the results of egg replacement experiments that assess the relationship between egg rejection behavior and the difference in appearance between own and foreign eggs. Ruppell's weaver (Ploceus galbula) eggs are variable in appearance between individuals and consistent within a clutch, but vary widely in the distinctiveness of particular traits. Most aspects of color and spotting are decoupled from each other, including coloration likely to derive from different pigments. Egg ground color is bimodal, with a broad continuous class of off-white/UV eggs and another broad class of blue-green eggs. Variation in all other traits is unimodal and usually normal in distribution. Females reject foreign eggs on the basis of the difference in brightness of the ground color and spotting of foreign eggs relative to their own, and the difference in degree to which spots are aggregated at the broad end of the egg. This aggregation is among the most distinctive features of their eggs, but the brightness of the ground color and spotting brightness are not; the birds' use of brightness rather than the more distinctive chromatic variation to recognize eggs might reflect the salience of achromatic contrast in a dim enclosed nest.",47,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

This hypothesis has been tested for intrinsic eggshell pigments as biliverdin (blue-green colouration) and/or protoporphyrin (brown coloured spots), but never for colourations applied post-laying. Post-laying staining colouration due to, for instance, uropygial secretion of the female could reflect its phenotypic properties and, thus, might be a cue for male investment in reproduction. In hoopoes, the uropygial gland of incubating females hosts symbiotic bacteria that are responsible for the brown colour of their uropygial secretion and of the eggshells, as they cover their bluish-grey eggshells with gland secretion after laying. The secretion protects embryos from pathogenic trans-shell infections and, thus, egg colouration may function as a cue or even as a post-mating sexually selected signal of antimicrobial potential in hoopoes. In a wild hoopoe population breeding in nest boxes in Spain, we test this hypothesis by exploring whether egg colour predicts male parental investment. In accordance with the hypothesis, we found that the amount of food provided by males to incubating females was higher in nests with less saturated eggshell colours. This relationship was affected by female body condition. High quality females in terms of body condition and/or in secretion colour obtained better males in terms of provisioning effort during incubation. Given that eggshell saturation is negatively related to density of bacterial symbionts in uropygial secretions, one possibility is that males may regulate their parental investment in accordance to the expected characteristics of mutualistic bacteria hosted in uropygial glands and deposited on eggshells. We discuss alternative explanations for our results, concluding that the post-mating sexual selection hypothesis is the most likely but experimental modification of egg colour is needed to test it further. √Ç¬© 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator-prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator-prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development.",55,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

The effects of this exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new and control-impact radiation treatment is used. In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of ``non-plant{''} indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests over ground.

Here, we investigated trophic cascades involving kaka, puriri moths and their host trees. New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis, Nestoridae) are large parrots that were extirpated from most of its range in the 20th century. Unlike most other parrots, kaka forage primarily by digging through the vascular cambium of trees in search of wood-boring insects. They regularly consume puriri moths (Aenetus virescens, Hepialidae), a giant species of ghost moth whose larvae tunnel into the heartwood of trees for protection. Puriri moths are host specific and frequently attack makomako (Aristotelia serrata, Elaeocarpaceae), a sub-canopy tree species. We conducted a field experiment in Zealandia, a nature reserve to which kaka were reintroduced over a decade ago, to test the hypothesis that kaka would increase tree fitness by removing larval parasites (i.e. herbivores). Contrary to our expectations, results revealed an additive, negative effect of both the predator (kaka) and parasite (puriri moths) on plant fitness.

In urban green spaces that require protection against pests, the numbers of snails may become greatly reduced in response to molluscicide treatments. The use of a molluscicide treatment against pest slugs in the Botanic Garden, L√É¬≥dz, Poland, in 2013 and 2014 provided a unique quasi-experimental setting to study the effect of molluscicide on both non-target snails and Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus eggs. Using a forest study site where no treatment was applied as a control area, we tested for effects of the molluscicide treatment in the Botanic Garden on the density of snails and on the egg volume of Blue Tits. We found that after the molluscicide treatment a dramatic drop in snail numbers occurred, which likely restricted the availability of snail shells for egg laying Blue Tits in the Botanic Garden. Correspondingly, egg sizes significantly decreased in the Garden, while they stayed constant over time in the forest. Eggs in bigger clutches were more strongly affected by the molluscicide treatment than eggs in smaller clutches. Our quasi-experimental study suggests that Blue Tits are sensitive to poor availability of snail shells. This is manifested by laying smaller eggs, which require less calcium to be incorporated in the eggshell, in response to a dramatic drop in the availability of snail shells.

In Valais, a stronghold of this species in the country, the birds breed in intensively managed vineyards and show a preference for parcels with ground vegetation during territory establishment. As a ground-breeder, the species is highly vulnerable to nest predation by avian and mammal predators. The aims of our study were firstly to investigate nest site preferences of the woodlark within vineyards and secondly to compare the predation risk of artificial nests dependent of ground vegetation structure. Our results point out that the Woodlark prefers patches of tall and dense ground cover within vegetated vineyard parcels and avoids parcels that have been treated with herbicides. In a follow-up experiment we conducted a study comparing the predation rate of artificial nests between bare parcels (<20\% vegetated area) and vegetated parcels (>40\% vegetated area). Artificial nests equipped with one quail egg were distributed pairwise between two adjacent parcels that fulfilled the upper criteria and were monitored by trail cameras during 10-12 days. Predation rate was generally low (4 predation events) and only occurred in bare parcels. These data indicate that conspicuousness of avian nests may be decreased in vegetated parcels and that the amount of vegetation can lower the predation risk on ground breeding birds another indication for the importance of ground vegetation for a successful conservation of the endangered Woodlark in Swiss vineyards.

Since fallows provide key resources for birds within the agricultural matrix, such as nesting sites, shelter and forage, complete understanding of the effect of field-management strategies on vegetation structure and food is essential to fulfill bird requirements and improve habitat management. In this study we experimentally compare the most common field practices (ploughing, shredding, herbicide application and cover cropping) on fallow lands by assessing the resources they provide for birds in terms of vegetation structure and food resources (leaf and seed availability), as well as the economic costs of their implementation. Fallow management treatments are ranked for six target species in a lowland area of the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, according to the available information on their requirements. The different agronomic practices offer various quantities and types of resources, highlighting the importance of fallow management in bird conservation. Shredding and early herbicide application (February) are estimated to be good practices for Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and Calandra Lark (Melanocorypha calandra), providing both favorable habitat and foraging conditions, while being economical. Meanwhile, superficial tillage in spring is found to be optimum for the rest of the species tested, despite being among the poorest food providers.

These cycles have been disturbed as night-time darkness is increasingly replaced by artificial illumination. Investigating the physiological consequences of free-living organisms in artificially lit environments is crucial to determine whether nocturnal lighting disrupts circadian rhythms, changes behaviour, reduces fitness and ultimately affects population numbers. We make use of a unique, large-scale network of replicated field sites which were experimentally illuminated at night using lampposts emanating either red, green, white or no light to test effect on stress hormone concentrations (corticosterone) in a songbird, the great tit (Parus major). Adults nesting in white-light transects had higher corticosterone concentrations than in the other treatments. We also found a significant interaction between distance to the closest lamppost and treatment type: individuals in red light had higher corticosterone levels when they nested closer to the lamppost than individuals nesting farther away, a decline not observed in the green or dark treatment. Individuals with high corticosterone levels had fewer fledglings, irrespective of treatment. These results show that artificial light can induce changes in individual hormonal phenotype. As these effects vary considerably with light spectrum, it opens the possibility to mitigate these effects by selecting street lighting of specific spectra. √Ç¬© 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Biological control (i.e. the use of biologically antagonistic organisms) is being considered as an alternative and an eco-friendly method to deal with plant diseases. Among such organisms several fungal endophytes have been successfully used to reduce or inhibit the growth of pathogens. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of several fungal endophytes to reduce the G. abietina spreading on pine seedlings, with the goal of exploring the mechanisms involved in that reduction. The experiment was carried out on two-year old Pinus halepensis seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Five fungal endophytes (Trichoderma spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Aureobasidium spp., endophyte 20.1 and Leotiomycete spp.) obtained from healthy P. halepensis trees were used to evaluate their effect on six G. abietina isolates. The pathogen and the endophyte were both inoculated in every seedling. At the end of the experiment seedlings were cut and brought to the laboratory where the necrosis length and total phenol content of the plant were measured. The pathogen presence was determined by a nested PCR with specific primers of G. abietina. The presence of all endophytes significantly reduced the necrosis length caused by G. abietina in most of the cases. However, the phenolic content of the plant, which is an indicator of the activation of the plant's defence mechanisms, had not increased with the endophyte inoculation. Therefore, the reduction in the necrosis observed could be attributed to a direct effect of the endophyte on the Gremmeniella spreading. These results suggest that the use of fungal endophytes could be an effective way to protect against G. abietina infections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",87,2,"excluded","Not birds"

Many captive birds, however, are housed indoors without access to natural light and without UV-supplemented lighting; a practice which may negatively impact their welfare. Understanding how birds use UV light, and assessing its relative importance, is necessary to provide optimal care in captive settings. Accordingly, we tested the preference for UV light shown by 67 birds housed at Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, USA, and its impact on their behavior. We tested 18 species which represented three natural ecologies typified by different natural light levels: high light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in savannas or seashores), patchy light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in forested areas), and circumpolar dwellers (e.g., birds that live near the poles). Experiment 1 investigated the birds' lighting preferences through simultaneous presentation of areas of their exhibit lit with supplemental ultraviolet light (UV+ zone) and with standard artificial light. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of supplemental UV light on these birds' behavioral repertoire. Birds from high light and circumpolar environments showed a preference for the side of their enclosure to which UV light was added. High light birds were recorded in the UV+ zone during 64\% trials and, similarly, circumpolar birds were observed in this UV+ zone for 61\% of trials; a significant preference for UV+ zone, P < 0.001 for both. Perhaps mimicking their natural habitat of part-sun and part-shade, in Experiment 1 birds from patchy light environments split their time evenly within their enclosure (they were recorded in the UV+ zone for 54\% of trials). When in an environment with added UV light, birds from patchy light habitats were more sociable: the percentage of their observation trials spent in proximity and in contact with other birds increased from 5\% to 11\% (P = 0.026). Although certain birds showed a preference for the added UV light, none showed changes in their behavioral repertoire beyond the sociability measure. We discuss this preference for UV-supplemented environments and the management implications for zoos and other captive facilities which house birds indoors. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While there is some empirical support for this idea, both theory and observations question its validity. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the influence of egg color on male American robin Turdus migratorius behavior by replacing natural clutches with four artificial eggs that were all either pale or vividly colored, close to the extremes in natural egg coloration. At the end of the incubation period, three unrelated nestlings were fostered into each experimental nest, and parental provisioning behavior was monitored when nestlings were 3, 6, and 9 days old. Male provisioning rate for 3-day-old nestlings was significantly higher in the vivid egg treatment compared to both the pale egg treatment and untreated controls, but there was no effect of egg color on paternal behavior at the older nestling stages. Male feeding rate at unmanipulated nests was only weakly positively related to natural egg color (chroma) when nestlings were 3 days old.

First, on account of birds being able to see in the ultraviolet spectrum, the interaction between the properties of avian vision and the light environment of nests imply different perceptions of egg coloration from those experienced by humans. Second, a new hypothesis to explain blue green egg coloration interprets it as a sexually selected signal to males of the laying female's genetic quality. Third, evidence from taxa as divergent as sparrowhawks and great tits indicates that protoporphyrin pigments responsible for maculation (spotting patterns) have a structural function in compensating for eggshell thinning, as caused by calcium stress, and, more recently, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. We consider this to be the most convincing explanation for the primary function of spotting, although an important secondary function might arise through the fact that individual patterns of maculation may allow birds to identify their own eggs, effectively serving as signatures in the face of inter- or intra-specific brood parasitism. These constraints or hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and should not be taken to imply that one, but not other, agents of selection might apply to any one species. However, the sexually-selected eggshell coloration hypothesis is least plausible for hole-nesting birds because of the poor light quality available, although such species have been the focus of research in this area, and only a single experimental study has shown a link between egg coloration and male provisioning. Furthermore, the observed relationships between female phenotypic quality and egg traits do not necessarily imply that they have signalling functions.

Zoological Studies 49(4): 437-452. Green turtles Chelonia mydas nest year round at the Ras Al Hadd Nature Reserve, Oman, with a distinct lower-density nesting season from Oct. to May, and a higher-density nesting season from June to Sept. On these beaches, the main predators of turtle eggs and hatchlings are foxes Vulpes spp., wolves Canis lupus arabs, and wild cats Felis spp. and Caracal caracal schmitzi. During 1999-2001, both the nesting behavior of these turtles and the diets of foxes (the main predator on the beaches) were investigated, and we tested whether female turtles were able to avoid/reduce predation pressure on their eggs and hatchlings on the nesting grounds. Elsewhere in the region and globally, foxes are known to feed on rodents, lizards, birds, and insects, but at Ras Al Hadd, their diet is basically composed of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings (comprising about 95\% in volume), with smaller contributions from other marine invertebrates (mostly ghost crabs Ocypode spp. and large gastropods), although they also sporadically ingested birds and lizards. The ability to adapt to a diet of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, on these beaches, is certainly a factor behind the success of this carnivore community in the arid lands of the Arabian Peninsula. Field experiments indicated that nesting sea turtles recognized both natural predators and humans as threats to their offspring, and this was reflected in modifications to their nesting behavior. In relatively undisturbed areas (by both natural predators and humans), sea turtle nest density was significantly higher, and nests were placed further away from the surf's edge, in contrast to results from relatively disturbed areas, where turtle nests were closer to the surf's edge, thus reducing the distance hatchlings had to travel when they emerge and begin their journey to the sea. Nesting turtles interrupted their nesting cycle if they sensed the presence of people or foxes, returning to the sea without laying a clutch. However, if they had already initiated oviposition when they sensed the presence of people and/or predators, they continued, although they significantly increased efforts to camouflage their nests. Other reasons behind nest site abandonment included sand collapsing events (critical during preparation of the egg chamber) and intraspecific competition for nest sites. These behavioral patterns of sea turtles result from their evolutionary adaptation to nesting on beaches, which surely played a role in their survival, but also highlight the importance of minimizing human disturbance and activities on turtle nesting beaches. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.4/437.pdf",116,2,"excluded","Not birds"

Such diaspores are considered as waste because the likelihood of plant recruitment is usually very small close to parent trees. However, many animals may rescue fallen diaspores and provide them with another chance of dispersal and establishment. We investigated the effectiveness of two broad types of seed dispersal vectors for the regeneration of Xylopia aromatica in the Brazilian cerrado savanna: birds that remove diaspores from plant canopies and ants that harvest diaspores on the ground under the parent plant (as rescuers) or from bird feces (as secondary dispersers). Birds removed a mean of 32% of the crop from plant canopies, but removal was independent of crop size. A large part of the crop (mean of 25%) landed beneath parent plants or was dropped after manipulation by vertebrate frugivores as viable diaspores. Ants from at least five genera removed most fallen diaspores (up to 83%) within 24 h. Ants influenced the fate of a large amount of the crop, and for some trees ants removed as many diaspores as birds. Large ants rescued some diaspores to distances beyond the parent plant crown, but birds may remove diaspores 40-fold farther. However, seedlings of X. aromatica were only found close to nests of large ants, probably due to diaspore rescuing and/or directed secondary dispersal by certain ant groups following primary dispersal by birds. Although an unknown percentage of seeds was lost to granivorous ants, diaspore removal by ants potentially enhances the likelihood of plant recruitment due to distance-related benefits and directed dispersal to ant nests, while birds play a premier role in long-distance seed dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. Synthesis. Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal at different spatial scales to X. aromatica. Since ants remove most fallen diaspores beneath parent plants, the use of diaspore removal rates from plant canopy as a surrogate of plant fitness may be misleading. By acting as secondary dispersers, ants may also provide a fine-tuned dispersal following long-distance dispersal by birds (i.e. diplochory). √Ç¬© 2010 The Authors.

We compared results with values reported in the literature to calculate usable space for winter food, loafing, nesting, and brood-rearing at 2 levels of spatial resolution. Treatments (k = 5) reflected a range of management intensities and were combinations of mechanical site preparation, chemical site preparation (CSP), and herbaceous weed control (HWC). Coverage of winter food plants in the least intensive treatment was more than double that in the most intensive; however, differences in usable space of winter food cover were negligible due to improved accessibility in more intensive treatments. Although CSP reduced coverage of nonpine woody plants across all years, loafing cover reached adequate levels by year 3 in all treatments. Usable nesting cover was <4\% across all years and treatments and was nearly eliminated by the reduction in herbaceous cover and visual screening cover following broadcast HWC. Optimal brood-rearing habitat was virtually absent in all treatments and years due to the lack of conjoint occurrence of bare ground and forb canopy. Although bobwhite habitat may have been promoted by formerly widespread plantation establishment methods that involved wide-scale soil disturbance, those established using newer methods with less soil disturbance are likely inadequate for most bobwhite habitat requirements. Efforts to provide bobwhite habitat in plantation-dominated landscapes may have to rely on management of thinned mid-rotation stands and permanent landscape features such as rights-of-way. The value of young plantations for bobwhite may be increased by reducing management intensity or increasing spacing between planting rows, thus increasing time before crown closure and providing opportunity for understory manipulations.",118,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

A special case is the secretion in the hoopoes Upupa epops, and green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus, which, contrary to the commonly white and odourless secretions, are dark with pungent odour. Recently, bacteria have been isolated from glands of both woodhoopoes and hoopoes and here we test the hypothesis that bacteria are responsible of some of the special properties of glands and secretions of this group of birds. We explore natural seasonal changes and intersexual differences in the properties of hoopoe glands and secretions, check the natural occurrence of bacteria within secretions, and analyse the effect of experimental injection of antibiotics on uropygial gland properties. Male glands underwent no seasonal changes, and their secretions were invariably white and odourless, very similar to female glands outside the breeding season. However, in comparison to the uropygial gland of non-breeding females, those of incubating females showed a marked increase in size and volume of secretion produced, which became dark and pungent. All these parameters increased until the hatching date and returned to values similar to those in the prelaying phase towards the end of the nestling period. Nestling glands produced secretions similar to those of females in colour and odour. Gland size of both females and nestlings predicted the amount of secretion produced. Microscopic techniques confirmed the presence of bacteria at high density and in active division in all dark secretions examined. The antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the load of enterococci in nestling glands, did not affect size of glands, but diminished the volume of secretion, which was lighter in colour than that of control nestlings. In nesting females, the experimental injection of antibiotic affected some measurements of gland size and secretion colour. Because the experiment did not affect general health estimates (immunocompetence, body condition or growing) of nestlings, our results suggest that some of the special properties of hoopoe glands are mediated by the presence of symbiotic bacteria. √Ç¬© 2009 The Authors.",122,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

The trials were repeated regularly throughout the course of two summers. 3. A distinct peak of larval mortality was recorded in mid-June (the nestling period for most insectivorous passerine birds), after which predation risk declined to a plateau of 20-30\% below the peak value. 4. The recorded pattern is interpreted as a consequence of seasonal changes in the number and behaviour of insectivorous birds, and the abundance of alternative food resources for these predators. 5. A quantitative analysis based on field data indicated that considering temporal variation in mortality in life-history models is crucial for obtaining realistic predictions concerning central life-history traits, such as final body size in different generations.",124,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

When there is doping (n √¢‚Ä∞¬† 0), the phase transition is metal-semimetal, the gap appears at a wave vector that is different from the Fermi-wave vector and an incommensurate structural phase transition takes place. This phase transition plays an important role in the formation of electron (or hole) bags, in the considerable increase of carrier DOS near the Fermi level and in the change of Cooper pair wave character that may lead to enhancement of superconducting TC in Quasi-two dimensional (Q2D) materials. The start of our study is that when the doping n is different from zero the nesting vector is different from (√è‚Ç¨,√è‚Ç¨) and defined by minimizing the energy of the system.

I present highlights from 19 years of studies on the Green-rumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus) in the Ilanos of Venezuela, based on marking and resighting over 7500 individuals and monitoring of 2500 nesting attempts in two populations breeding in nest boxes. Initial work focused on the causes and consequences of the extreme hatching asynchrony exhibited by parrotlets. Examining an exhaustive set of fitness correlates at experimentally synchronized or asynchronized nests found no evidence that asynchrony benefited hatching patterns. The consequences of not caring for eggs during laying were severe, as unincubated eggs lost their viability rapidly and eggs left in unguarded nests were frequently destroyed by nonbreeding pairs. Work over the past decade has focused on understanding parrotlet social system and population dynamics. Parrotlets have a complex social system composed of male-female nesting pairs, nonbreeding male-female pairs, male-male pairs, and nonbreeding males occurring primarily alone or in groups that sometimes molest breeders. Nonbreeders composed up to 50\% of the males that are resighted during years when populations are large. Extra pair fertilizations were uncommon (< 8\% of young). Divorce rarely occurs in breeding pairs, but pairs typically breed together for only 1-2 years. Male-male pairs were young individuals that traveled together, allopreened each other, and entered nest boxes together. Parrotlets have strong site fidelity and form two breeding populations connected by dispersing juveniles. The two sites are 600 in apart, but differ in elevation by 1-2 m, in soil type, and flooding regime. These differences can result in differences of up to 6 weeks in the onset of nesting in rainy years, but not in dry years.

In this field study on another cavity-nester, tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, we tested whether yarrow reduced ectoparasite loads (the nest protection hypothesis), stimulated nestling immune systems (the drug hypothesis), or had other consequences for nestling growth or parental reproductive success (predicted by both preceding hypotheses). Tree swallows do not naturally add greenery to their nests, and thus offer several advantages in testing for effects of greenery independent of other potentially confounding explanations for the behaviour. We placed fresh yarrow in 23 swallow nests on the day the first egg was laid, replenishing every two days until clutch completion (=three times), and at 44 control nests, nesting material was simply touched. At 12 days of age, we measured nestling body size and mass, and took blood smears to do differential white blood cell counts. We subsequently determined the number and proportion of young fledging from nests and the number of fleas remaining after fledging. Higher humidity was associated with higher flea numbers whereas number of feathers in the nest was not. Our most significant finding was that an average of 773 fleas Ceratophyllus idius was found in control nests, versus 419 in yarrow nests. Possibly, parents compensate for blood that nestlings lose to ectoparasites by increasing food delivery, because we detected no differences between treatments in nestling mass, nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion of young fledging, or relative to flea numbers.

In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment.

Aim: To assess if nestboxes of different construction and colour were occupied differently by breeding tits and affected breeding success. Methods: A total of 292 nestboxes of different construction and colour were placed in a range of habitats and their occupancy, and the clutch size, brood size and number of young fledged of the birds that used them were measured. Results: Overall 272 tit nests were included in the analysis. Although there were species-related differences in the occupancy of the different types of nestboxes, more tits nested in the boxes constructed from woodcrete (64% of nests) compared to the wooden boxes (36%). More tits nested in green (72%) rather than brown boxes (28%) and in boxes with entrance holes (68%) rather than wedges (32%). The clutch size, brood size and number of young fledged did not vary in relation to nestbox type. Conclusion: Within the parameters of the experimental design of this study, tits are more likely to nest in woodcrete boxes than in wooden boxes, and in wooden boxes that are green and have holes rather than brown boxes with wedge entrances.

In birds, parents have been shown to invest more into egg production and nestling care when paired with an attractive rather than an unattractive mate, as predicted by the differential allocation hypothesis. Here we investigate variation in the female's and male's share of incubation behaviour, a vital, and costly, period of parental care during which the embryo is vulnerable to perturbations in developmental conditions. We manipulated the attractiveness of male zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, using red or green leg-rings. To simulate their natural social environment we allowed them to breed in outdoor aviaries. All males within an aviary were given the same coloured ring to avoid ring-colour related assortative mating. Males within a colony, however, were still expected to show some variation in attractiveness with the earliest laying females possibly pairing with the most attractive males. Indeed we found that both factors played a role in explaining female incubation effort. Among females mated to red ringed males, earlier laying females contributed significantly more to incubation than late laying females, but no such pattern was found in females mated to green ringed males. Overall, there were no differences in the level of incubation provided by both parents between treatment groups, suggesting some compensation within the pair. Hatching success was correlated with a pair's total incubation effort. These results suggest that variation in the division of parental care between the sexes is in agreement with both increased effort of females mated with attractive males, and females compensating for the reduced effort of attractive males seeking further mating opportunities. These two factors can act at the same time in natural populations and both should be considered when explaining variation in division of labour between the sexes. √Ç¬© Journal of Avian Biology.",144,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

For each of 30 declining species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4) specific conservation measures and (5) agri-environment schemes. Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed-eating birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all 30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from options available in one or more agri-environment schemes. Four aspects of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1) weed-control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of hedgerows and `rough patches', have affected smaller numbers of species, as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at least eight species have shown recent increases in their national population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of agricultural practice is changed.",145,2,"excluded","Not empirical"

Exogenous factors, such as daylength, can also exert a measure of control: photoperiodic cues detected by birds that hatch late in the season induce accelerated juvenile development, assuring that late-hatched young migrate at the same time as early-hatched young. Whether these same mechanisms of control also apply to birds that migrate between breeding and nonbreeding areas entirely within the tropics at latitudes characterized by little seasonal variation in photoperiod is unknown. We conducted a common-garden experiment in Panama (9degreesN) in which we hand-reared wild-caught nestling yellow-green vireos, Vireo flavoviridis, under a constant photoperiod and monitored them for the expression of juvenile moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity. Even in the absence of a seasonal photoperiodic cue, juveniles moulted, accumulated fat reserves and initiated migratory activity, suggesting endogenous control of these processes. Age at the onset of moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity were each significantly negatively correlated with hatch date, however, so that the expression of these three processes was synchronized among juveniles with respect to the time of the season. We suggest that the slight differences in daylength perceived either by the nestlings themselves in the short time before they were collected (at 6-8 days of age) or by the adult females during egg production influenced rate of nestling development, thus allowing later-hatched young to moult, accumulate fat and migrate at a younger age than early-hatched young.

However, males of some songbird species, such as the European starling (Stumus vulgaris), continue to sing at high levels after the breeding season, when T levels are basal. In male starlings song during the breeding season functions mainly to attract mates, whereas song during the nonbreeding season appears unrelated to reproduction. This suggests that song produced in a context unrelated to female courtship, unlike song directed toward females, is not regulated by plasma T. In captive males housed in large outdoor aviaries we explored the relationship between plasma T and song produced during the breeding season within and outside a courtship context. This was achieved by determining the effects of castration and subsequent T treatment on song and mate attraction behaviors in both the presence and the absence of a female. Compared to intact males, castrated males did not show reduced song activity in the absence of a female for at least 6 months after the operation, strongly suggesting that the expression of noncourtship song is not regulated by plasma T. Likewise, we found that experimentally elevating T levels in castrated males did not affect noncourtship song rates. However, control castrated males receiving empty implants tended to show reduced noncourtship song rates after implantation. This may have been due to a suppressive effect caused by the presence of the T-implanted castrated males in the same aviary. In contrast, courtship singing was clearly controlled by plasma T: it was abolished by castration and restored by subsequent T replacement when males were housed both individually and in a group situation. High plasma levels of T also appeared necessary for the activation of three other behavioral traits critical for mate attraction, namely, nesthole occupancy, spending time (singing) in a nesthole, and carrying green nesting material into a nesthole.

Song activity, nest-box occupation, the carrying of green nesting materials into a nest hole (typical mate-attraction behaviors), and aggression occur much more frequently in males who also have higher testosterone (T)-levels than females. Here, we examined whether male-like concentrations of T would activate these behaviors in female Starlings. We treated females with implants that were either empty (C-females) or packed with T (T-females) during late December. Although elevated T-levels significantly increased song activity in females, the proportion of time spent singing was still much lower than in males. T-treatment in females also failed to induce singing behavior in the nest box, a typical male mate-attraction behavior. Those results suggest both activational and organizational effects of T on singing. Nest-box occupation, carrying of green nesting material into a nest hole, and aggressive behavior were not activated by elevated T-levels, indicating that sex differences in these behaviors are probably based on early organizational effects of steroid hormones.

Such large-scale manipulations of a key element of most ecosystems offer unique opportunities to investigate how the loss of large carnivores affects communities, including the extent, if any, of interactions at different trophic levels. Here, we demonstrate a cascade of ecological events that were triggered by the local extinction of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) from the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These include (1) the demographic eruption of a large, semi-obligate, riparian-dependent herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), during the past 150 yr; (2) the subsequent alteration of riparian vegetation structure and density by ungulate herbivory; and (3) the coincident reduction of avian neotropical migrants in the impacted willow communities. We contrasted three sites matched hydrologically and ecologically in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA, where grizzly bears and wolves had been eliminated 60-75 yr ago and moose densities were about five times higher, with those on national forest lands outside the park, where predation by the two large carnivores has been replaced by human hunting and moose densities were lower. Avian species richness and nesting density varied inversely with moose abundance, and two riparian specialists, Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and MacGillivray's Warblers (Oporornis tolmiei), were absent from Park riparian systems where moose densities were high. Our findings not only offer empirical support for the top-down effect of large carnivores in terrestrial communities, but also provide a scientific rationale for restoration options to conserve biological diversity. To predict future impacts, whether overt or subtle, of past management, and to restore biodiversity, more must be known about ecological interactions, including the role of large carnivores. Restoration options with respect to the system that we studied in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are simple: (1) do nothing and accept the erosion of biological diversity, (2) replace natural carnivores with human predation, or (3) allow continued dispersal of grizzly bears and wolves into previously occupied, but now vacant, habitat.

Other factors such as hunting, refuge management, diet quality, weather may affect survival and reproduction. We studied time-energy budgets, food intake, and body condition to determine how Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) of the Mississippi Valley Population (MVP) acquire and utilize energy and nutrients during autumn, winter, and spring migration during 1984-1989. Abundant food and behavioral flexibility allowed MVP Canada geese to exist on a high nutritional plane. Food intake was sufficient to meet or exceed daily energy and protein requirements except during winter. High energy, low protein diets fueled deposition of large lipid reserves, and were adequate to meet protein requirements during autumn in east-central Wisconsin. Late migrant geese that spent autumn in east-central Wisconsin expended more energy (x = 583 kcal/day) yet deposited more lipid (x = 4.51 g) compared to early migrants that spent autumn in southern Illinois (x = 526 kcal/day, x = 151 g lipid) during 1984 and 1985. Both groups averaged 4.5 hr feeding/day during autumn and consumed similar quantities (dry mass) of food (x = 187-190 g/day). However, late migrants consumed a high energy (x = 3.67 kcal/g) low protein (x = 12\%) diet comprised mostly of corn (x = 81\%) during autumn in east-central Wisconsin. Early migrants consumed a lower energy (x = 2.99 kcal/g) but higher protein (24\%) diet that consisted mostly of green forages (x = 24\% dry mass) in soybeans (x = 28\%) in southern Illinois. Wintering geese consumed a high energy (x = 3.49 kcal/g) diet with intermediate protein content (x = 19\%). Corn (x = 58\%) and soybeans (x = 22\%) comprised most of dry matter intake during winter in southern Illinois when daily energy expenditure averaged 536 kcal/day. However food intake declined (x = 152 g food/ day) during winter when geese averaged 3.5 hr feeding/day. Variation in crop food energy relative to population energy requirements on 2 southern Illinois refuges did not impact body condition during 1984-1989. Nutrient reserves contributed minimally (<1-6\%) to meeting daily energy requirements, so geese left winter refuges with more lipid and similar protein masses compared to early autumn. Geese exhibited a wide range of behavioral adaptation to spatial and temporal variation in food resources and nutritional requirements. Late migrants entered winter with larger energy reserves than early migrants during 1984-1989. Although early and late migrants were sympatric in southern Illinois during winter, they converged to similar levels of body condition by the end of winter during 1986-1989. Late migrants apparently used stored energy to reduce food intake, possibly to minimize mortality during winter. Early migrants apparently minimized exposure to hunting by feeding almost entirely within refuges during autumn. With smaller energy reserves, early migrants maintained higher levels of energy intake to maintain body condition after autumn, possibly increasing mortality risk during winter. We expected more similar trends in body condition between early and late migrant Canada geese, and more consistent losses of nutrient reserves each year if winter weight declines were driven by an endogenous physiological rhythm. We see no reason to invoke an endogenously driven physiological mechanism to explain winter weight losses in MVP Canada geese. Without controlled metabolic experiments, we prefer the simpler and more plausible explanation that winter weight declines result from facultative adjustments of feeding behavior to weather conditions, food availability, and pre-winter nutrient reserves. Overwinter survival should be enhanced by an energetic strategy that balances potential benefits and risks of feeding in relation to the size of remaining nutrient reserves. Decline of the early migrant tradition during the 1990's suggests that the energetic strategy of late migrants is more suited to recent harvest and refuge management regimes. Adults deposited 73\% (females) and 28\% (males) of their spring protein reserves while migrating between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Spring lipid reserves were acquired mostly (84\% in females, 92\% in males) during a 4-5 week staging period in east-central Wisconsin. Juveniles deposited 41-51\% of lipid reserves and 80-91\% of protein between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Feeding time (x = 5.8 hr/day), and food intake (x = 263 g/day) increased during spring-staging when lipid reserves more than doubled. Spring-staging geese consumed a moderate energy (x = 3.25 kcal/g) low protein (x = 13\%) diet that was more evenly composed of corn (x = 50\%), wild seeds and rootstocks (x = 21\%), and green forages (x = 27\%) compared to autumn and winter. Deposition of nutrient reserves was neither time- nor resource-limited during spring migration. Thus, food resources likely did not limit reproduction of MVP Canada geese under the conditions we observed during 1984-1989. Shallow wetland and moist soil habitats can be enhanced on southern Illinois refuges to benefit a wider diversity of wetland-dependent species and provide nutritional resources for geese without compromising energy available to support wintering populations. However, geese still need an abundant source of energy during autumn and winter, particularly when foraging opportunities are restricted by inclement weather or hunting. Food restriction on winter refuges during long and late-closing hunting seasons in the 1990's may have contributed to long-term changes in autumn migration patterns and wintering traditions in southern Illinois. Forage and non-crop foods are essential sources of protein and other nutrients during all seasons. but are especially important during spring migration. Shallow wetlands and lowland pastures on private lands in central Illinois and east-central Wisconsin are critical sources of non-crop foods that provide essential nutrients that geese use to complete the nesting cycle. Thus, reproduction could be impaired in the future if changing land use and farming practices reduce availability of moist soil and lowland pasture habitats.",164,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

In addition to eggshell thinning caused by high levels of DDT and metabolites, the reproductive impairment is characterized by high embryonic and chick mortality, edema, growth retardation, and deformities, hence the name Great Lakes embryo mortality, edema, and deformities syndrome (GLEMEDS). The hypothesis has been advanced that GLEMEDS in colonial fish-eating birds resembles chick-edema disease of poultry and has been caused by exposure to chick-edema active compounds that have a common mode of action through the cytochrome P-448 system. Detailed evidence has been collected from the following three groups of studies on herring gulls in the lower Great Lakes during the early 1970s; Forster's terns in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1983; and double-crested cormorants and Caspian terns in various locations in the upper Great Lakes from 1986 onwards. It has proved difficult to establish not only the onset of the disease in the various species at various locations but also the period in which chick-edema active compounds were released. Anecdotal evidence suggested that serious egg mortality in Lake Ontario herring gulls first occurred in 1966, though the signs of chick-edema disease were not looked for until 1974. Only indirect evidence is available on the date of the release of one of the presumed causal agents, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, but highest levels may have occurred in the early to mid 1960s. More reliable data show that the onset of the improvement of reproduction of Lake Ontario herring gulls coincided with the declines in organochlorine compounds and particularly 2,3,7,8-TCDD and PCB. Similarly, information on the onset of the disease and exposures in the Forster's tern and double-crested cormorants in Green Bay is uncertain but bird banders did not observe deformities until the 1970s, which corresponds with the onset of high levels of PCB. If the disappearance of the Caspian tern from Saginaw Bay in the mid 1960s corresponds with the onset of GLEMEDS at that location, then there is a close temporal relationship to the onset of high PCB levels. Chick-edema disease is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific lesion, but rather there is a suite of lesions. GLEMEDS is characterized by an elevated incidence of embryonic and chick mortality, growth retardation, and developmental abnormalities, including bill deformities, club feet, missing eyes, and defective feathering, and there is also subcutaneous, percardial, and peritoneal edema, liver enlargement, liver necrosis, and porphyria. These signs conform to the known symptoms of chick-edema disease. A variety of chick-edema active compounds, including non-ortho-substituted PCBs and dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans substituted at the lateral positions, produce chick-edema disease. The active compounds have specific conformational requirements. In considering evidence on the strength of association, the embryos and chicks of herring gulls from Lake Ontario and Forster's terns from Green Bay had a significant increase in the incidence of the lesions compared to the reference colonies. Similarly, the incidence of bill abnormalities was significantly elevated in Great Lakes colonies of double-crested cormorants particularly for Green Bay, Wisconsin. There was a significant dose-response relationship between the incidence of embryonic mortality in cormorant eggs and the presence of chick-edema active compounds expressed in 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents. There is a high degree of consistency on replication. The disease has been found in a variety of species in a variety of locations, by different observers using different study designs. Outbreaks of the disease have occurred at different times and seem only to be related to exposures of developing embryos to high levels of chick-edema active compounds. The new facts, that embryos and chicks of colonial, fish-eating birds can exhibit signs resembling chick-edema disease when exposed to chick-edema active compounds, cohere with existing biological theory, experience, and experimentation. There are plausible routes of exposure and sources of these compounds to the Great Lakes, and statistically significant dose-response relationships have been demonstrated.",183,1,"excluded","duplicate"

Two consecutive studies were conducted to investigate effects of nest-box environment on nidicolous parasites, bacteria and fungi, as well as nest success, in blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major. The first compared microclimate and parasite and pathogen load in plastic and wooden nest boxes. The second tested the nest protection hypothesis-that birds naturally incorporate aromatic herbs into nests to decrease nest parasites and pathogens-by comparing parasite and pathogen load in plastic nest boxes to which aromatic or non-aromatic plant material was added. No significant difference in nest-box temperature or relative humidity was found between plastic and wooden boxes.

Although many species of plants recruit ants to obtain protection from herbivores, myrmecophily is rare, since only few plant species are known to be adapted for pollination predominantly by ants. The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the √¢‚Ç¨Àúant-pollination syndrome√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services. √Ç¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",189,1,"excluded","Not birds"

The SPS in this study were areas with exotic trees of Eucalyptus globulus globulus for paper pulp production planted in a 2 √É‚Äî 2 design (two meters between each tree) over diverse, native grasses. The OPS were large open areas with a great diversity of native grasses, herbs, and small plots of trees where the animals could rest and shelter from extreme weather conditions. Over the course of one year, individual body weights and a number of specific animal welfare indicators were measured every 45 days. After a descriptive analysis, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Gaussian distribu-tion, with time and system (OPS or SPS) fitted as fixed effects and individuals nested by herd as random intercepts, was used. The results showed that weight gain did not differ between the two systems. None of the animals showed any sign of impaired welfare in either system over the study period. Silvopastoral systems offer animals a sustainable and richer environment that will improves their welfare.

The following year, a further outbreak in the same aviary occurred in a different flock of goldfinches. At the time of the second outbreak, dead and sick common sparrows (Passer domesticus) discovered near the aviary were also found to have systemic isosporosis. Method: The systemic isosporosis was investigated and described using histopathology, electron microscopy and sequence analysis of the 18s gene. Results: Isospora spp. infecting the greenfinch and the goldfinch caused significant thickening of the duodenal lamina propria. Measurements in the goldfinches showed an inverse correlation coefficient between the thickening of the duodenum and the weightof the birds. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of Isospora spp. within lymphocytes migrating into the lamina propria of the duodenum. Analysis of the 18s sequence discovered two different gene sequences across the three species of birds that didn't completely match any sequences previously deposited in GenBank. Conclusion: Although the sparrows were found to have died from causes other than systemic Isospora, molecular studies of samples from their liver revealed the presence of an Isospora with 18s gene sequence identical to that found in the captive greenfinches. √Ç¬© 2020 Australian Veterinary Association",200,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

It has been suggested that arteriolar annuli localized in retinal arterioles regulate retinal blood flow acting as sphincters. Here, the morphology and protein expression profile of arteriolar annuli have been analyzed under physiologic conditions in the retina of wildtype, √é¬≤-actin-Egfp, and Nestin-gfp transgenic mice. Additionally, to study the effect of hypertension, the KAP transgenic mouse has been used. METHODS. Cellular architecture has been studied using digested whole mount retinas and transmission electron microscopy. The profile of protein expression has been analyzed on paraffin sections and whole mount retinas by immunofluorescence and histochemistry. RESULTS. The ultrastructural analysis of arteriolar annuli showed a different cell population found between endothelial and muscle cells that matched most of the morphologic criteria established to define interstitial Cajal cells. The profile of protein expression of these vascular interstitial cells (VICs) was similar to that of interstitial Cajal cells and different from the endothelial and smooth muscle cells, because they expressed b-actin, nestin, and CD44, but they did not express CD31 and a-SMA or scarcely express F-actin. Furthermore, VICs share with pericytes the expression of NG2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-√é¬≤). The high expression of Ano1 and high activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase observed in VICs was diminished during hypertensive retinopathy suggesting that these cells might play a role on the motility of arteriolar annuli and that this function is altered during hypertension. CONCLUSIONS. A novel type of VICs has been described in the arteriolar annuli of mouse retina. Remarkably, these cells undergo important molecular modifications during hypertensive retinopathy and might thus be a therapeutic target against this disease. √Ç¬© 2019 The Authors.",211,1,"excluded","Not birds"

We combine ringing data on nestling measurements of two vultures (lappet-faced and African white-backed vulture) with land-use and environmental variables. We show that body condition of white-backed vulture nestlings decreased through the study period and was lowest inside protected areas. For the lappet-faced vulture, nestling condition was improved during harsh years with lower than average vegetation greenness assumed to result in increased ungulate mortality, but only within protected areas. Such interaction was not tested for the white-backed vulture due to collinearity. The species-specific effects of land-use and vegetation greenness on nestling condition of the two sympatric vulture species likely stem from their different life-histories, diet preferences and foraging behaviour. While translation of current findings on nestling conditions to their possible influence on population demography and species persistence require further studies, our findings demonstrate how environmental change may trigger selective bottom-up ecosystem responses in arid environments under global change. √Ç¬© 2018, The Author(s).",212,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Yet, almost nothing is known about embryonic survival after such high pre-incubation temperatures. Freshly laid bobwhite quail eggs were exposed during a 12 day pre-incubation period to one of five thermal regimes: low oscillating temperatures (25√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú40√Ç¬∞C, mean = 28.9√Ç¬∞C), high oscillating temperatures (30√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú45√Ç¬∞C, mean = 33.9√Ç¬∞C), low constant temperatures (28.85√Ç¬∞C), high constant temperatures (mean = 33.9√Ç¬∞C), or commercially employed pre-incubation temperatures (20√Ç¬∞C). After treatment, eggs were then incubated at a standard 37.5√Ç¬∞C to determine subsequent effects on embryonic development rate, survival, water loss, hatching, and embryonic oxygen consumption. Both quantity of heating degree hours during pre-incubation and specific thermal regime (oscillating vs. non-oscillating) profoundly affected important aspects of embryo survival and indices of development and growth Pre-incubation quail eggs showed a remarkable tolerance to constant high temperatures (up to 45√Ç¬∞C), surviving for 4.5√Ç¬±0.3 days of subsequent incubation, but high oscillating pre-incubation temperature increased embryo survival (mean survival 12.2√Ç¬±1.8 days) and led to more rapid development than high constant temperature (maximum 38.5√Ç¬∞C), even though both groups experienced the same total heating degree-hours. Oxygen consumption was ~200√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú300 √é¬ºl O2.egg.min-1 at hatching in all groups, and was not affected by pre-incubation conditions.

Our results further suggest an advance of the local food peak in the Arctic under 1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2√Ç¬∞C climate warming, which will likely cause migrating geese to mistime their arrival at the breeding grounds, particularly considering the Arctic warms faster than the temperate regions.

In the present study, we show the relationship between cell-cycle phase and chemotherapy-induced tumor angiogenesis using in vivo FUCCI real-time imaging of the cell cycle and nestin-driven GFP to detect nascent blood vessels. We observed that chemotherapy-treated tumors, consisting of mostly of quiescent cancer cells after treatment, had much more and deeper tumor vessels than untreated tumors. These newly-vascularized cancer cells regrew rapidly after chemotherapy. In contrast, formerly quiescent cancer cells decoyed to S/G2 phase by a telomerase-dependent adenovirus did not induce tumor angiogenesis. The present results further demonstrate the importance of the cancer-cell position in the cell cycle in order that chemotherapy be effective and not have the opposite effect of stimulating tumor angiogenesis and progression. √Ç¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",226,1,"excluded","Not birds"

The simplification and homogenisation of agricultural landscapes has led to dramatic losses of farmland biodiversity. This decline includes passerine populations and one of the mechanisms that may be contributing toward this may be increased nest predation. Ground covers are agri-environmental measures whose objective is to halt the loss of biodiversity by creating high-quality habitat patches embedded in a homogeneous landscape by maintaining herbaceous ground cover within crops. However, although such patches are selected by breeding birds, they may also attract predators, and an increased nest density in small habitat patches would thus result in increased predation rates. We have therefore performed nest predation experiments with artificial nests in order to investigate whether the effect of ground cover on nest predation is density dependent. The experiments were carried out during the breeding season in 2014, in two areas of olive groves in southern Spain. We used two nest density levels, both in olive groves with ground cover and in those where the ground was bare. A total of 420 nests were placed, 226 of which (53.81%) suffered predation. Our results showed that 1) nest predation was density dependent in olive groves with ground cover only with respect to tree nests, while there was no density-dependent predation in bare-ground olive groves of either ground-based or tree nests, and 2) artificial nests placed on the ground were more frequently depredated (65%) than those placed in trees (29%), irrespective of either the presence of vegetation cover or nest density. This study suggests that variations in patterns of nest predation are determined by the identity of nest predators and their specific foraging behaviours in different landscapes and habitats. It also underscores the need to implement agri-environmental measures aimed at the conservation of farmland birds.",235,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

With the objective of predicting the nesting habitat of red-crowned crane in Zhalong Nature Reserve, we obtained nesting occurrence records for this species from the study area collected from 2012-2013, extracted the environmental factors from the thematic mapper (TM) image of Zhalong Nature Reserve in 2013. We analyzed the nesting habitat suitability of red-crowned crane by the combined use of a GIS and MAXENT model. The results showed that the accuracy of the MAXENT model was excellent (training data area under the curve=0.901). The greenness vegetation index (34.9%), man-made interference (namely, the distance to frequently disturbed zones from human activity, 17.1%), soil wetness index (16.3%), and elevation (15.7%) were the main environmental factors influencing the nesting habitat selection of red-crowned crane. The central and south regions of the core zone were the main suitable nesting zones, and there was a small area of suitable habitat in the buffer zone and the experimental zone; the suitable nesting habitat area was 35857.35 hm2, representing about 17.07% of the whole reserve. The results showed that the core zone is the most important management zone for red-crowned crane nesting, and the reserve should also pay more attention to the small reed marsh area in the buffer zone and the experimental zone. √Ç¬© 2016, Ecological Society of China.

Previous studies indicated grazing showed various impacts on small rodents; however, most studies were conducted over 1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2√Ç¬†years without controlling for confounding factors such as immigration/emigration and predation in rodents. Brandt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the following 3√Ç¬†years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity. Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total phenol content). Our findings highlight the urgent need for more flexible management of yearly rotational grazing to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health. √Ç¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",80,1,"excluded","duplicate"

Potential hosts can reduce the cost of parasitism by rejecting foreign eggs from the nest. Observational, comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to identify parasitic eggs (egg√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúnest contrast hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally test whether egg√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúnest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two colours: orange and green. Contrary to the egg√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúnest contrast hypothesis, host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn, experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg rejection rate. Our results demonstrate that egg√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúnest contrast is a collateral, not a causal factor in egg rejection, and confirm the conclusions of previous studies that hosts can rely on the parasitic egg√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s appearance itself to recognize the foreign egg in the nest. √Ç¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",240,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

It is based on bird habitat use of fields at the time of pesticide applications. It accounts for spatio-temporal heterogeneity at population and landscape scales.We identify and quantify the potential exposure to 179 ASs of 140 clutches during pre-laying, laying, and incubation phases, and of 75 coveys. The data come from a large scale field study combining radiotelemetry and a farmer survey. They were collected in 12 different representative sites.The proportion of clutches potentially exposed to a given chemical was √¢‚Ä∞¬•5% for 32 ASs; prothioconazole and epoxiconazole ranking first. 71% of clutches were potentially exposed to √¢‚Ä∞¬•1 AS and 67% to √¢‚Ä∞¬•2 ASs. Mixtures involved 2 to 22 ASs. They emerged from commercial formulations, tank mixtures, bird habitat use, and combinations. ASs were fungicides (53%), herbicides (25%), and insecticides (16%) used on a variety of crops in April-June, when ground-nesting birds are breeding. The European Food Safety Authority conclusions report a long-term first-tier toxicity-to-exposure ratio (TERlt) &lt;5 for 11 out of 19 documented ASs, and higher-tier TERlt &lt;5 for 5 out of 10 ASs.

However, there are limitations with their use related to the availability, immunogenicity, and uncertainty of the mechanisms involved. To address these issues, definitive NSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated using a nonviral, piggyBac transposon approach, were investigated. Committed NSCs were generated from iPS cells using a free-floating neurosphere methodology previously described by our laboratory. To delineate the mechanism of action, specifically the role of exogenous myelination, NSCs derived from wildtype (wt) and nonmyelinating Shiverer (shi) iPS cell lines were used following thoracic SCI with subacute intraspinal transplantation. Behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological outcomes wereanalyzedtoassess the effectivenessof this treatment. Thewt- andshi-iPS-NSCswere validatedand shown to be equivalent except in myelination capacity. Both iPS-NSC lines successfully integrated into the injured spinal cord and predominantly differentiated to oligodendrocytes, but only the wt-iPS-NSC treatment resulted in a functional benefit. The wt-iPS-dNSCs, which exhibited the capacity for remyelination, significantly improved neurobehavioral function (BassoMouse Scale and CatWalk), histological outcomes, and electrophysiological measures of axonal function (sucrose gap analysis) compared with the nonmyelinating iPS-dNSCs and cell-free controls. In summary, we demonstrated that iPS cells can generate translationally relevant NSCs for applications in SCI. Although NSCs have a diverse range of functions in the injured spinal cord, remyelination is the predominantmechanismof recovery following thoracic SCI. √Ç¬© 2015 AlphaMed Press.",242,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Removal of dead cells and debris by phagocytes is necessary for tissue homeostasis. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that cultured SVZ cells phagocytose both 1 and 2 √é¬ºm latex beads and apoptotic cell-derived fragments. We determine by flow cytometry that phagocytic cells represent more than 10% of SVZ cultured cells. Phenotyping of SVZ cells using nestin, GFAP, Sox2, or LeX/SSEA and quantification of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, reveals that cells with neural stem-cell features phagocytose and represent more than 30% of SVZ phagocytic cells. In vivo, nestin-, Sox2-, and ALDH-expressing neural stem-like cells engulfed latex beads or apoptotic cell-derived fragments that were injected into mice lateral brain ventricles. We show also that SVZ cell phagocytic activity is an active process, which depends both on cytoskeleton dynamic and on recognition of phosphatidylserine eat-me signal, and is stimulated by the vitamin K-dependent factor protein S (ProS). ProS neutralizing antibodies inhibit SVZ cell phagocytic activity and exposure of SVZ cells to apoptotic cell-derived fragments induces a transient Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK) phosphorylation. Conversely, MerTK blocking antibodies impair both basal and ProS-stimulated SVZ cell phagocytic activity. By revealing that neural stem-like cells act within the SVZ neurogenic niche as phagocytes and that the ProS/MerTK path represents an endogenous regulatory mechanism for SVZ cell phagocytic activity, the present report opens-up new perspectives for both stem cell biology and brain physiopathology. √Ç¬© 2014 AlphaMed Press.",247,1,"excluded","Not birds"

ADSCs transduced with lentivirus were able to generate NSC-like cells, without any effects on their growth, phenotype, and normal differentiation potential. NSC-like cells derived from ADSCs formed neurospheres and expressed high levels of the neural progenitor marker nestin.

It is, however, not known how well astrocytes tolerate traumatic injury and hypoxia, which are unavoidable when preparing acute slices. We here showed that astrocytes exhibit striking changes in expression of several receptors and structural proteins, including re-expression of the developmental marker nestin within 90 min following preparation of live vibratome slices. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy showed a 2.7-fold loss of astrocytic processes in acute hippocampal slices prepared from glial fibrillary acidic protein-green fluorescent protein reporter mice. A sharp decrease in the number of mitochondria was also noted in acute slices, concurrently with an increase in mitochondrial size. Glycogen content decreased 3-fold upon slice preparation and did not recover despite stable recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic current. Analysis of Ca2+ signaling showed that astrocytic responses to purine receptor and mGluR5 agonists differed in slice versus in vivo.

In choice experiments, starlings employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can only discriminate odours during the reproductive season. The association between odour perception and reproductive behaviour suggests that increased testosterone production, related to the increasing photoperiod in spring, may guide these seasonal changes. The size of the olfactory bulb but not its ability to discriminate was affected by testosterone implants in the non-reproductive season. √Ç¬© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.",263,1,"selected",NA

It provides the developmental environment for the embryo and nestling thereby affecting their quality and survival. Nests are often constructed by the male and nest quality, elaboration, and ornamentation vary among males in a species. Therefore, male nest-building behaviour is likely under sexual selection and females may use male nest-building behaviour and nest features as cues in mate choice and their own reproductive investment. We tested this hypothesis in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Male starlings present green plants to females during their courtship display and furbish their nests with variable quantities of fresh green plants. The highest frequency of plant incorporation into the nest occurs during pair formation and oogenesis. We determined nest composition and measured yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs. Yolk testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with the amount of green plant material in nests. Because males use green nest material in courtship and green nest material positively affects nestlings' development, we suggest that female European starlings use male nest-building effort, ritualised courtship display of green plants, and nest characteristics in mate choice, and adjust yolk testosterone levels in the eggs to the quality of the nest to optimise offspring growth.",264,1,"selected",NA

The American thrashers exhibit great variation in egg colouration and patterning, and also show variation in male brood patch development. A recent hypothesis suggests that conspicuous egg colouration has evolved as the product of sexual conflict, where females may create conspicuous eggs to obtain greater amounts of male care, either in the form of male incubation or incubation assistance to prevent their eggs from being vulnerable to visually orienting predators and brood parasites. The American thrashers, a genus comprising of 10 species, exhibits striking variation in egg colouration and patterning, and also show variation in male brood patch development. By using avian visual modelling, I show that blue-green chroma of American thrasher eggs is positively related to their degree of conspicuousness against a nest background, while brown chroma is negatively related. Interestingly, the degree of male brood patch vascularisation is directly related to eggshell conspicuousness in American thrashers. I suggest that in the American thrashers, male brood patch vascularisation has evolved in response to conspicuous eggshell colouration to mitigate visual risks. Here I show that the degree of male brood patch vascularisation is directly related to relative paternal incubation effort in more than 300 North American breeding birds. This suggests that American thrasher species that possess both conspicuous eggs and brood patches, have most likely evolved to keep these conspicuous nest contents concealed, thereby reducing risk of visual detection. I suggest that these patterns are not unique to thrashers, but may extend to several avian families.",265,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

However, the consequences of this behaviour for the females are still poorly known. In this study, we evaluated the behavioural responses of female Spotless Starlings to the green plants that they find in their nests. We added green plants to a group of experimental nests (E nests) and quantified the activity of the nesting females in the E nests and in a group of non-manipulated nests (C nests). The females never added green plants to their nests, but they removed the green plants more frequently from the E nests than from the C nests. The number of departures from the nest by females that carried green plants was positively correlated with the number of visits by females that carried nothing. In contrast, the number of departures by females carrying green plants was uncorrelated with the number of visits made by females that carried nest-building materials. These results suggest that the females made a specific additional effort to remove the green plants from the E nests. We propose that this behaviour may be an adaptive response of mated females that serves to counteract the eventual negative effects of green plants on their reproductive success. However, competing hypotheses cannot be rejected, and additional work is needed to better understand the removal of green plants by female Spotless Starlings. √Ç¬© 2011 Dt.

This study reports on a within-species comparison of breeding schedules and metal egg temperatures in uni- and biparental sanderlings (Calidris alba) in Northeast Greenland in relation to ambient temperature. We recorded incubation schedules with nest temperature loggers in 34 sanderling clutches (13 uniparentals, 21 biparentals). The temperature of a metal egg placed within the clutch of 17 incubating birds (6 uniparentals, 9 biparentals) was measured as an indicator of the heat put into eggs. Recess frequency, recess duration and total recess time were higher in uniparentals than in biparentals and positively correlated with ambient temperatures in uniparentals only. Uniparental sanderlings maintained significantly higher metal egg temperatures during incubation than biparentals (1.4√Ç¬∞C difference on average). Our results suggest that uniparental sanderlings compensate for the lower nest attendance, which may prolong the duration of the incubation period and negatively affect the condition of the hatchlings, by maintaining a higher heat flux into the eggs. √Ç¬© 2011 Reneerkens et al.",276,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Parrots are highly social and make substantial daily movements, which appear to be mediated through contact calling. However, there is little experimental evidence for how free-ranging parrots recognize social companions. We quantified intra- and interindividual variation of contact calls in a banded population of green-rumped parrotlets in Venezuela. Recordings of a sample of males were made on replicate days as they announced their return to incubating mates. Spectrographic structure of these contact calls showed significantly more variation between than within individuals, and calls could be correctly classified to individuals more often than was expected by chance. Males varied across multiple dimensions simultaneously, including duration, frequency and frequency modulation of contact calls. Playback experiments showed that free-ranging female parrotlets responded significantly more often to their mates' calls than to calls of males of other nests.

The present study explored how hematopoietic-derived cells would respond to neurogenic signals from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult and aged (6 and 16 months old) rats. The mononuclear fraction of HUCB cells was transplanted into the SVZ of immunosuppressed (single cyclosporin or three-drug treatment) animals. The triple-suppression paradigm allowed us to protect transplanted human cells within the brain and to explore further their phenotypic and migratory properties. One week after implantation, many surviving HUCB cells were located within the SVZ and the vertical limb of the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The migration of HUCB cells was restricted exclusively to the pathway leading to the olfactory bulb. In younger animals, grafted cells navigated almost halfway through the vertical limb, whereas, in the older animals, the migration was less pronounced. The overall cell survival was greater in younger animals than in older ones. Immunocytochemistry for surface CD antigen expression showed that many HUCB cells, either cultured or within the brain parenchyma, retained their hematopoietic identity. A few cells, identified by using human-specific antibodies (anti-human nuclei, or mitochondria) expressed nestin and doublecortin, markers of endogenous neural progenitors. Therefore, it is believed that the environment of the neurogenic SVZ, even in aged animals, was able to support survival, """" neuralization,"""" and migratory features of HUCB-derived cells. √Ç¬© 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",316,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Consistent with theoretical predictions, annual offspring sex ratio was highly correlated with mean July air temperature, validating concerns about the effect of climate change on population demography. This correlation implies that even modest increases in mean temperature (<2√Ç¬∞C) may drastically skew the sex ratio. Statistical evaluation of the variance in climate change indicates that an increase in mean temperature of 4√Ç¬∞C would effectively eliminate production of male offspring.

Tufted duckling brood use of the lake increased greatly and Tufted duckling survival appears to have increased. (3) 3. Shoveler and Pochard nested successfully for the first time. (4) 4. Submerged aquatic macrophytes grew profusely over the lake bed for the first time leading directly to large increases in use of the Lake by wintering herbivorous waterfowl. (5) 5. When fish were re-introduced to the Main Lake sampling bay the increases in invertebrate abundance and, to a less marked extent, macrophyte abundance were reversed. Fish removal is advocated as a potentially potent form of habitat management for waterfowl conservation areas. √Ç¬© 1994 Kluwer Academic Puhlishers.",342,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

The median estimated TCDD equivalents were almost 11-fold higher in tern eggs from Green Bay than in eggs from Lake Poygan (2175 and 201 pg/g). The hatching success of Green Bay sibling eggs from nests where eggs were collected for contaminant analyses was 75% lower at Green Bay than at Lake Poygan. Hatchability of eggs taken from other nests and artificially incubated was about 50% lower for Green Bay than for Lake Poygan. Among hatchlings from laboratory incubation, those from Green Bay weighed approximately 20% less and had a mean liver weight to body weight ratio 26% greater than those from Lake Poygan. In both field and laboratory, mean minimum incubation periods were significantly longer for eggs from Green Bay compared to Lake Poygan (8.25 and 4.58 days, respectively). Mean minimum incubation time for Green Bay eggs in the field was 4.37 days longer than in the laboratory. Hatchability was greatly improved when Green Bay eggs were incubated by Lake Poygan adults in an egg-exchange experiment, but was sharply decreased in Lake Poygan eggs incubated in Green Bay nests. Nest abandonment and egg disappearance were substantial at Green Bay but nil at Lake Poygan. Thus, not only factors intrinsic to the egg, but also extrinsic factors (parental attentiveness), impaired reproductive outcome at Green Bay. The epidemiological evidence from this study strongly suggested that contaminants were a causal factor. AHH-active PCB congeners (intrinsic effects) and PCBs in general (extrinsic effects) appeared to be the only contaminants at the concentrations measured in eggs, capable of producing the effects that were observed at Green Bay. √Ç¬© 1989 Springer-Verlag.",357,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Recently, there have been many reports of German blackcaps wintering in Holland, England and Ireland.

Multi-unit electrophysiological recordings from olfactory nerves of adults indicated that strong responses were reliably elicited by volatiles from six plant species. After pairings of plant volatiles with gastro-intestinal malaise, birds exhibited conditioned avoidance in behavioural experiments, and made all possible pairwise discriminations between volatiles of the various plant species. Bilateral olfactory nerve cuts prior to conditioning abolished the ability to acquire avoidance, suggesting that olfactory cues mediated the response to plant species.

Furthermore, adults were yellower than nestlings, and for both groups the males were yellower than the females. Experimental interchange of eggs between nests showed that the variation in plumage colour observed between broods was related primarily to the food and not to genetic differences.

Mixed-habitat bird species appeared to be more general in their nest microhabitat requirements than forest birds. Because shrub patches functioned as refugia for nesting mixed-habitat birds, patchy systems should have a higher fitness than homogeneous systems.

The present paper describes some experiments on the function of this response, and on the stimuli eliciting it. Carrion Crows and Herring Gulls find white eggs more readily than normal gulls' eggs; it is concluded that the natural colours of the eggs afford a certain degree of cryptic protection. When normal eggs are given an egg shell at 15 cm. distance their vulnerability is greatly increased; this √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbetrayal effect√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ decreases rapidly with increased distance between egg and shell. We therefore conclude that egg shell removal helps to protect the brood from predators. As reported by C. BEER (1960) the Black-headed Gull removes a surprisingly wide range of objects from the nest. Large scale tests with egg shell dummies in which colour, shape, size and distance from the nest were varied showed that objects of all colours are carried but that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìkhaki√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ (the normal ground colour of the egg) and white are particularly stimulating, while green elicits very few responses. Egg shells elicit more responses than cylindrical rings of the same colour, and these are responded to better than √¢‚Ç¨≈ìangles√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ. Size can be varied within wide limits; very large rings elicit fear which interferes with removal. Various other indications are mentioned which show that the score as obtained in the mass tests does not accurately reflect the responsiveness of the reaction itself but rather the result of its interaction with other behaviour tendencies. The eliciting effect decreases rapidly with increasing distance. On the whole, the gulls' response is very well adapted to its main function of selectively removing the empty shell, but the relatively high scores for objects which have very little resemblance to egg shells suggest that it is adapted to the removal of any object which might make the brood more conspicuous. A pilot test showed that gulls which have incubated black eggs respond better to black egg shell dummies than normal gulls. The lack of promptness of the response as compared with non-colonial waders (Ringed Plover and Oystercatcher) is adaptive, since it tends to reduce predation by other Black-headed Gulls, which are shown to prey selectively on wet chicks. A hitherto unrecognised function of territory is suggested. In a discussion of the entire anti-predator system of the Black-headed Gull its complexity and its compromise character are stressed: the safety demands of the individual clash with those of the brood; there are conflicts between the several safety devices which each benefit the brood; and there are clashes between the ideal safety measures required by each type of predator.",383,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Only bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds make bowers. The bower is on the ground and has no direct connexion with the nest, which is built in a tree that may be some hundreds of yards away. At each bower is a display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩground which the owner strews with coloured flowers, fruit and shells, or, in some species, pallid or reflecting articles. These, contrary to general belief, are selected with great discrimination. Members of three genera paint their bowers with fruit√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩpulp, or with charcoal or comminuted dry grass mixed with saliva. Cat√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds, on the other hand, do not erect a special structure. Pioneer nineteenth√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩcentury naturalists, who knew little about bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds, ascribed a courtship function to the above activities and postulated an aesthetic sense as well. During the last three decades, however, there has arisen a school of Australian naturalists, which, though admitting that the displays of bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds may have had their origins in sexual utilitarianism, believe that this has become a minor factor. They hold that modern bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds are intelligent, consciously aesthetic, and that they carry out their complex display activities essentially for relaxation or recreation. This theory is here rejected. Experimental work has shown that gonadectomy inhibits display and bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilding and that injections of testosterone re√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩestablishes it. Post√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩnuptial (out√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩof√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩseason) display occurs after the seasonal metamorphosis of the testes and the rehabilitation of the interstitium, and is of the same nature as the autumnal display of other birds. Excluding one monospecific genus (Archboldia) of whose bower only fragmentary knowledge is available, true bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds appear to fall into two distinct groups. These are (i) the avenue√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilders (Ptilonorhynchus, Chlamydera, Sericulus) (Fig. i) and (2) the maypole√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilders (Prionodura, Amblyornis) (Fig. 2). The avenue√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilders are widespread throughout both Australia and New Guinea. Each lays down a foundation platform of twigs, and in this wedges twin parallel walls of twigs which sometimes arch overhead. At one, or sometimes both, ends of the bower the male birds arrange their display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩthings. One species replaces the terminal display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩgrounds with two additional walls which are built at right angles to the original ones. It thus achieves three avenues, in all of which it places decorations. Among avenue√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilders the male builds a bower early in the season, after which it attracts a female to the bower and there displays to it at the focal point of its territory. The male rapidly achieves spermatogenesis but the female cycle lags behind. The male displays (√¢‚Ç¨Àúdances√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢) for several months, while the female remains passively in waiting. During this lengthy period of androgen liberation there occurs the remarkable display of bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩpainting, vocal mimicry of other birds, and the insatiable collection of coloured or otherwise distinctive display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩthings. In one, and possibly several, species the collected display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩobjects are coloured similarly to the watching female. With these in his beak the male displays energetically and often violently but does not approach the female. This has led to published references to √¢‚Ç¨Àúsexual fetishism√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ in bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds. There is, however, a fundamental difference between the above normal and constant avian activity and a form of psychopathic sexual behaviour in man. Likewise, although the male bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds' prolonged preoccupation with display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩobjects while he is in a breeding condition involves a form of sexual sublimation, it is important to remember that this too is normal and constant and a means towards, rather than a sublimation of, reproductive efficiency. The display with the ornaments before the watching female continues unabated until the forest becomes seasonally full of the special protein food on which the young are fed. Then only is the male's physical attention transferred from his display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩthings to the waiting female. The female now leaves the bower, alone to build the nest and to rear the young. The male continues his display. His testes, unlike those of most birds, do not metamorphose after the young appear. Thus he remains potentially polygamous, although polygamy has not been proved. In ascribing an essentially utilitarian function to the bower and associated activities, it is not suggested that bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds do not enjoy their extraordinary performances. Further, it is emphasized that bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds appear to have developed their display beyond the bounds of strict utilitarianism, since some individuals successfully reproduce without painting their bowers, and it has been experimentally shown that reproduction (in the aviary without competition) can take place in the absence of coloured decorations. The maypole√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilders, with one exception, are confined to the dense rain√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩforests of New Guinea. The fundamental maypole structures are a central growing sapling with a cone of fabric packed around its base. One species, measuring only 9I inches long, extends this cone to a height of about nine feet. Another species surmounts a dwarf cone with a conical, waterproof hut. A third builds over the cone a hemispherical hut fronted by a stockade, and a fourth surmounts the basal cone with a cylinder of moss and fibre which extends up the basic sapling. Fruits, flowers, beetles' wing√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩcases and other coloured objects are used to decorate various parts of the structures or their surroundings. Bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilding of both avenue and maypole types probably originated as a form of displacement activity. The males as well as the females of most passerine birds possess an inherent urge to build nests. To√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩday only female bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds seem to build nests. These are built of twigs. The males, on the other hand, have taken to building twig bowers on the display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩground. Here they spend much of their time during the sexual season. The display√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩground is the focal point of their activity, and, together with the female, of their interest. Nest√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilding among females is essentially controlled by the seasonal liberation of hormones. The same appears to be true of male bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilding. In short, nest√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilding is of a bisexual nature, and this has made possible bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩconstruction as a displaced building drive, the new product of which has become valuable, ritualized and permanent in the course of the evolution of each species. Bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩpainting is a displaced form of the courtship feeding that is widespread among passerine and other birds. Instead of projecting this attention on the watching female the male does so on his bower which, along with its decorations, is his chief physical preoccupation (apart from feeding and threat) during the weeks or months of spermatogenesis. Of the three cat√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds, two greenish species indulge in arboreal displays in much the same manner as other passerine birds, whilst the third, the brown stagemaker of tropical Queensland, has taken partly to the rain√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩforest floor. Here it clears a space on the ground and covers this with fresh leaves which it cuts each morning by means of a √¢‚Ç¨Àútoothed√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ beak. The leaves are placed with paler under√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩsurfaces uppermost, thus creating the more striking effect against the dark earth. From a singing√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩstick above the decorated stage the bird calls loudly and continuously and thus advertises its presence and its decorated stage to every potential mate or rival within many hundreds of yards. The precise function of the stage is unknown, but the scanty available data suggest that it, and the vocal display from above, are means toward the cementing of the pair√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbond and effecting the synchronization of the joint sexual processes of the pair. Finally, perhaps, it is the mating place when the monsoon begins and brings with it the seasonal harvest of insect food on which the young will be fed. It has been suggested by cabinet√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩworkers that √¢‚Ç¨Àúbower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbuilding has been developed coincidentally or perhaps independently√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (Iredale, 1950) and √¢‚Ç¨Àúseems to be imitative√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ and not indicative of close relationship (Mathews, 1926). This view is rejected. It is believed that the study of bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds as living animals shows that they fall into two distinct families, each of whose members are much closer allied than has been thought. The cat√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbirds probably form a family by themselves. Cnemophilus, first considered to be a bird√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩof√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩparadise, and next a bower√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩbird, should be reinstated to its original classification. Copyright √Ç¬© 1954, Wiley Blackwell.

In each of 332 experiments, one of four animals used as tasters was presented with a choice as between two egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩsamples. Possible disturbing factors such as differences in egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩsize or shell√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩcoloration, and those due to spatial arrangement of the samples, were eliminated by the use of raw egg, offered in equal quantities, and by the successive reversal in position of the egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩspecies matched within a particular group of experiments, or as offered to a particular experimental animal. The reliability of the experimental method and the degree of consistency of hedgehog discrimination was checked by repetition experiments (between the same species√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩpair), both for the same and for different individuals; and by linking and overlapping experiments (between pairs of egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩspecies more or less widely separated in the edibility series). In general, the results show the hedgehog to be sensitive to differences in the relative palatability of the eggs offered, and to be consistent in its preferences and aversions, which show a broad agreement with those of man for the egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩspecies considered. Separate experimental results are tabulated; the evidential value of the groups of experiments is discussed; and the edibility status of the several species considered.

The species fall broadly into three grades√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúhere shown in descending order of acceptability√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúas follows: (a) Palatable.√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúKittiwake (Rissa t. tridactyla), Eider (Somateria m. mollissima), Razorbill (Alca torda britannica), Gannet (Sula bassana), Domestic Fowl (Gallus gallus).

Little Grebe (Podiceps r. ruficollis), Buzzard (Buteo b. buteo), Arctie Tern (Sterna macrura), Ringed Plover (Charadrius h. hiaticula); (c) Distasteful.√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúBlackbird (Turdus m. merula), Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs gengleri), Sedge√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩWarbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), Whitethroat (Sylvia c. communis), Linnet (Carduelis c. cannabina). Grounds are given for the belief that the preferences shown by hedgehogs are likely to correspond with those of other egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩeating animals, and that, within the limits of the series examined, they afford a satisfactory basis for consideration of the data in general terms. The wide range in specitie edibility rating found to occur within certain orders. suggests that relative acceptability may be largely independent of systematic status: however, the low mean edibility rating for Passeriform species indicates a trend towards nauseousness within this order. No close or obvious connexion has been traced between relative acceptability of the egg and feeding habits of the parent: nor is the quality of the egg at all constantly related to that of the flesh in the species examined. On the other hand, the experimental results point towards correlations between relative acceptability and various other ecological factors likely to influence susceptibility to attack by predators. Firstly, there is a broad direct relationship between palatability of the egg and size of the parent. Secondly, the distribution, in terms of acceptability, of species having colonial and solitary nesting habits, respectively, shows a marked tendency for eggs of the former to be more, and those of the latter to be less palatable. Thirdly, consideration of egg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩpalatability in relation to nest√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩsite, indicates that eggs laid in open nests in moderate growth or low herbage may be relatively distasteful as compared with those laid in various other situations. Fourthly, a general correlation is shown to exist between coloration of the shell and palatability of its contents. Broadly, cryptic eggs tend to belong to the higher edibility grades, and distinctively marked eggs to the lower edibility grades. The several species have been assessed in terms of relative vulnerability, account being taken of such factors as size, weapons of defence, powers of offence, availability of the clutch, general habits, sociability and coloration. A general inverse correlation is shown to exist between the degree of vulnerability and that of acceptability√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúthe most palatable eggs being those laid by non√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩvulnerable species, the most nauseous by those that are (otherwise) highly vulnerable. It is suggested that the facts point towards an adaptive interpretation of distastcfulness in eggs, coasidered as a deterrent to attack; and that the distinctive coloration of nauseous but otherwise vulnerable eggs may have a warning or recognitional value in relation to potential predators. 1951 The Zoological Society of London",385,1,"excluded","Not birds"

The beams, from three guns mounted together in a 2-inch diameter neck, are deflected by a single deflection yoke. The guns are pointed so that the electron beams converge to a spot on a thin, perforated metal sheet that acts as a mask and is located a short distance away from a viewing screen composed of many phosphor dots. Associated with each hole in the mask is a trio of phosphor dots capable of emitting the three primary colors, red, blue, and green. The dots are so placed that each electron beam as it scans can √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsee√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ only one dot of the trio. Each of the three beams is thus capable of exciting one color only, and when all three beams √É¬•re modulated with the appropriate primary color information, a picture in full color can be reproduced. An apparatus called the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlighthouse√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ is used to record the locations of the phosphor dots on a photographic plate placed behind the mask and in the plane of the phosphor screen. A point source of light, at the position from which the deflection of one of the beams appears to take place, is used to simulate the electron beam in recording the phosphor dot positions. The pattern for one color of phosphor is the same as for the other two colors, and the geometry of the hole system in the mask is such that the three phosphor patterns nest together perfectly. The phosphor screens may be made by using various processes such as, electrostatic printing, offset printing, photoprinting processes, silk screening, and settling. The latter two methods have been used in the tubes described in the text. Experimental tubes have shown the principles of operation and construction to be sound.

Several studies however suggest that passerines can perceive volatile compounds in several biologically relevant contexts. In Corsica, recent findings suggest that cavity-nesting blue tits may use volatile compounds in the context of nest building and maintenance. Although they build their nests mainly from moss, female blue tits also frequently incorporate fragments of several species of aromatic plants in the nest cup. In field experiments, breeding female blue tits altered their nest maintenance behaviour in response to experimental addition of aromatic plants in their nest. In aviary experiments. captive male blue tits could be trained to detect lavender odour from a distance. Here I report results from a field study aimed to test whether adult blue tits altered their chick-feeding behaviour after an experimental change in nest odour composition. I experimentally added fragments of aromatic plant species that differed from those brought in the nests before the start of the experiment in a set of experimental nests and added moss, the basic nest material, in a set of control nests. Both male and female blue tits hesitated significantly longer entering the nest cavity after addition of new aromatic plant fragments, as compared to moss addition. This response was especially observed during the first visit following the experimental change in nest plant composition. Nest composition treatment had no effect on the time spent in the nest.

Empirical research on the potential role of nests or nest features as sexual signals, however, is comparatively scarce for avian species in which the female is the only sex involved in its construction because of a male bias in the study of sexual traits, even though maternally built nests may be more common than paternally and biparentally built nests. In blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, females alone build nests and add aromatic plants to them. We manipulated nest size and amount of aromatic plants in the nest to assess subsequent male effort and risk taking during provisioning of nestlings as indices of differential allocation. Risk taking was assessed through trappability indices of males at the nest-box when provisioning nestlings. Although male provisioning rates did not differ between experimental groups, male risk taking during provisioning was significantly lower in nests reduced in size than in control and enlarged nests, and it was significantly higher in nests supplied with aromatic plants than in control nests. Females showed nonsignificant trends to increase their provisioning effort in reduced nests, probably to compensate reduced male investment. Finally, female provisioning rates and especially male risk taking had a major positive impact on reproductive success and thereby on female fitness. In summary, this study (and previous evidence) suggests that nest size and aromatic plants in blue tit nests are used by females as sexual signals to elicit differential allocation in males. This study adds to the scarce evidence in favor of nests or nest materials acting as sexually selected traits regarding female signaling. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2013 The Author.

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2009 Journal of Avian Biology.",24,2,"selected",NA

Here we have substituted one egg in certain pied flycatcher clutches with a single deep-blue (blue) or light-blue (pale) dummy egg and used other clutches as controls. Blue dummy eggs reflected more in the blue-green part of the spectrum than natural and pale dummy eggs, which were similar in reflectance. Nestlings in nests with one blue dummy egg during laying and incubation attained a significantly higher mass and condition than those in nests with one pale dummy egg or in control broods, when controlling for phenology, brood size and blue-green chroma of the clutch.

In vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs. Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival. Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link environmental conditions to population productivity and viability. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",29,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi.

Among potential mid-contract management practices used to maintain early-successional CRP grasslands, cattle grazing had been prohibited and is currently disincentivized during the primary nesting season for birds (much of the growing season), despite the important role that large herbivores historically played in structuring grassland ecosystems. Conservative grazing of CRP grasslands could increase spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure and plant diversity, potentially supporting higher densities of some grassland bird species and higher bird diversity. Our objective was to determine the effect of experimental cattle grazing on species-specific relative abundance and occupancy, species diversity, and community dissimilarity of grassland birds on CRP grasslands across the longitudinal extent of Kansas, USA (a 63.5-cm precipitation gradient) during the 2017-2019 avian breeding seasons. Fifty-three of 108 fields were grazed by cattle during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 and all fields were rested from grazing in 2019. For all analyses, we examined separate model sets for semiarid western versus more mesic eastern Kansas. Using data from line transect surveys, we modeled relative abundances of 5 songbird species: grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), dickcissel (Spiza americana), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Grazing had delayed yet positive effects on abundances of grasshopper sparrow in western Kansas, and eastern meadowlark in eastern Kansas, but negative effects on dickcissel abundance in western Kansas and especially on burned fields in eastern Kansas. Somewhat counterintuitively, brown-headed cowbirds in western Kansas were more abundant on ungrazed versus grazed fields in the years after grazing began. In addition, we modeled multi-season occupancy of 3 gamebird species (ring-necked pheasant {[}Phasianus colcicus], northern bobwhite {[}Colinus virginianus], mourning dove [}Zenaida macroura]) and Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii); grazing did not affect occupancy of these species. In eastern Kansas, species diversity was highest in grazed, unburned fields. In western Kansas, bird communities in grazed and ungrazed fields were dissimilar, as determined from multivariate analysis.

In wild birds, artificial illumination alters many natural behaviors that are important for fitness, including chick provisioning. Although incubation is a key determinant of the early developmental environment, studies into the effects of ALAN on bird incubation behavior are lacking. We measured nest temperature in nest boxes of great tits during the incubation period in two consecutive years. Nest boxes were located in eight previously dark field sites that have been experimentally illuminated since 2012 with white, green, or red light, or were left dark. We tested if light treatment affected mean nest temperature, number of times birds leave the nest (off-bout frequency), and off-bout duration during the incubation period. Subsequently, we investigated if incubation behavior is related to fitness. We found that birds incubating in the white light during a cold, early spring had lower mean nest temperatures at the end of incubation, both during the day and during the night, compared to birds in the green light. Moreover, birds incubating in white light took fewer off-bouts, but off-bouts were on average longer. The opposite was true for birds breeding in the green light. Low incubation temperatures and few but long off-bouts can have severe consequences for developing embryos. In our study, eggs from birds that took on average few off-bouts needed more incubation days to hatch compared to eggs from birds that took many off-bouts. Nevertheless, we found no clear fitness effects of light treatment or incubation behavior on the number of hatchlings or hatchling weight. Our results add to the growing body of literature that shows that effects of ALAN can be subtle, can differ due to the spectral composition of light, and can be year-dependent. These subtle alterations of natural behaviors might not have severe fitness consequences in the short-term. However, in the long term they could add up, negatively affecting parent condition and survival as well as offspring recruitment, especially in urban environments where more environmental pollutants are present. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Copyright √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 van Dis, Spoelstra, Visser and Dominoni.",48,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

We compare the impact of biocontrol, provided by bats and birds, with that of crop raiding by vervet monkeys on yield in South African macadamia orchards. Insectivorous bats and birds are known to feed on macadamia pest insect species, like the macadamia nut borer or the green vegetable bug. Vervet monkeys move into the orchards during the day to feed on premature macadamia nuts. Bats, birds and monkeys benefit from patches of natural vegetation adjacent to orchards. With exclusion experiments (four treatments: day, night, day and night, control) we quantified the relative importance of biocontrol and crop raiding on yield, comparing two different landscape settings of the orchards, a natural and a human-modified. Crop raiding occurred only close to natural vegetation and caused yield losses of about 26%. Biocontrol by bats and birds was higher near natural vegetation, but still significant in human-modified landscapes, at up to 530√É‚Äö√Ç¬†m distance to forest patches. Prevented biocontrol through the exclusion of bats and birds resulted in yield losses of up to 60%. Effects of biocontrol by bats and birds (USD ~5,000√É‚Äö√Ç¬†ha/year) were economically more important than the losses of crop raiding (USD ~1,600√É‚Äö√Ç¬†ha/year). As both are linked to the vicinity of forest patches, the removal of natural vegetation to limit monkey abundances would also limit biocontrol service provision. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the high economic benefits of biocontrol by bats and birds, which outweighed negative impacts through yield losses caused by crop raiding monkeys. Management practices to prevent crop damage, such as guarding, excluding vertebrates or removal of adjacent natural vegetation, would also limit access for bats and birds and the great economic benefits provided by their biocontrol. Ecosystem services by bats and birds can be promoted by the exposure of artificial roost and nest sites, but research into species-specific preferences is needed. The education of farmers is crucial, as many are unaware of the benefits from birds and bats and the fact that these benefits can outweigh the disadvantages of the monkeys√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ crop raiding. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, egg retrieval is an ancient, and likely ancestral, widespread behaviour in birds. However, it has received little attention in studies of avian brood parasitism, perhaps because most parasitism occurs in species with complex nests, a context in which egg retrieval seems irrelevant. However, for cavity-nesting hosts of avian brood parasites, egg retrieval may still play an important role in the coevolutionary interactions between obligate brood parasites and hosts, because egg retrieval can be considered to be antagonistic to egg rejection behaviour in hosts, yet both may involve cognition to recognize eggs. We hypothesized that (1) cavity-nesting hosts should retrieve misplaced eggs from outside the nest cup, (2) brood parasitism has modulated egg retrieval behaviour in cavity-nesting hosts and (3) hosts use the same visual cues for decision-making during egg recognition in both egg retrieval and egg rejection actions. To test these hypotheses, we performed a series of experiments in a cavity-nesting host, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus). Foreign eggs with different levels of mimicry were placed within or outside nest cups of hosts to test their responses. We found that host decisions about whether to retrieve or reject an egg both depended on the degree of mimicry. However, hosts sometimes first retrieved poorly mimetic foreign eggs and then rejected them. Alternatively, hosts sometimes failed to retrieve highly mimetic conspecific eggs. We suggest that egg retrieval in hosts is likely to be a result of the interaction between ancient retrieval behaviour and subsequent adaptation against brood parasitism.

Widespread, long-term population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have elicited concern about negative effects of livestock grazing on sage-grouse populations. Hypothesized relationships, mostly untested, between livestock and sage-grouse nesting ecology have played a prominent role in shaping public land livestock grazing policy and broader discussions about management of grazing in sagebrush ecosystems. We tested predictions arising from several commonly hypothesized mechanisms by which livestock may affect nesting habitat quality for sage-grouse in a grazed landscape in central Montana, USA. We employed Bayesian variable selection methods to identify factors related to both nest site selection and nest success, focusing on indices of livestock use at local and pasture scales and including other factors known to influence nesting ecology such as anthropogenic features and weather. In spite of some evidence nest survival was positively associated with senesced vegetation height, evidence for effects of livestock presence and indices of local livestock use on nest site selection and survival was equivocal at best. In contrast, we found strong evidence that females selected nest sites based on relatively static features such as sagebrush cover and distance from gravel and paved roads, whereas nest failure was driven primarily by extended periods of heavy precipitation. Management of sage-grouse nesting habitat in this region should focus on conserving areas of adequate shrub cover and preventing further fragmentation by roads. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

A greater understanding of these traits, particularly those that are unique to females, may shed light on the potential for sexual selection to shape female phenotypes. Recently, blue-green eggshell colour, derived from the antioxidant pigment biliverdin, has been proposed as a candidate trait that advertises female quality to males in species of birds with biparental care. However, studies have been equivocal in their support for blue-green eggshell colour being an informative signal, and correlations between eggshell colour and other female characteristics have been inconsistent. We conducted a supplementation experiment to test if improving the access of female birds to food resources and micronutrients, thereby improving their condition prior to egg laying, would intensify the blue-green colouration of the eggs they laid. We provided mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides with food and carotenoids during nest building and egg laying in two breeding seasons, and assessed both within- and among-clutch variation in colour. Supplementation did not affect patterns of within-clutch variation, but did result in differences in colour among clutches. Specifically, we found that food, but not carotenoids, resulted in higher colour saturation, and decreased the brightness of blue-green eggshells. Although this trend was observed in both years, the effect was statistically significant only in one year. Our results suggest that food supplementation influences eggshell colour, but that conditions, such as weather and natural food availability, which can vary annually, may also determine how female birds allocate pigment to eggshells.",65,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Previous studies have suggested that insectivorous birds can detect the HIPVs for prey location. The production of HIPVs is partly mediated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate is one compound involved in the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Therefore, spraying of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) solution on plants can induce the emission of volatiles similar to the HIPVs induced by herbivory. We performed two field experiments to test whether insectivorous adult birds are attracted to Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) treated with MeJa solutions. We used artificial larvae to measure bird predation rate. There were no differences in the predation rates of plasticine larvae between control and MeJa treatments, suggesting that insectivorous birds were not attracted to trees treated with MeJa. We also tested whether blue tit nestlings without previous experience in foraging respond to the scent of Pyrenean oak tree leaves treated with MeJa, to test whether the attraction to MeJa-treated trees is innate. A similar number of nestlings performed begging responses when exposed to the scent of leaves of MeJa-treated trees compared to the scent of leaves of control untreated trees. Furthermore, the duration of the first begging was similar in response to the volatiles emitted by MeJa-treated trees and untreated trees. Despite previous evidence suggesting that insectivorous birds are attracted to HIPVs, our results show that neither insectivorous adult birds nor inexperienced nestlings were attracted to trees treated with MeJa. Further studies are needed to disentangle whether the differences in the emission of volatiles between herbivore-infested trees and MeJa-treated trees can explain this lack of attraction to MeJa-treated Pyrenean oak trees. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2018 Copyright 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",66,2,"excluded","No green nest material

This reclamation can provide a novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to 2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis, and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK, between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat) and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e., microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking, prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites. On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age. Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g., nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing bobwhite.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of eggshell coloration. In this experimental study, we tested two hypotheses (signalling-function hypothesis and structural-function hypothesis) on both eggshell pigment types in an open-nesting songbird, the canary (Serinus canaria). Also, we aimed to examine whether deposition of pigments into the eggshell has any cost in terms of the plasma oxidative status of the female. We found that eggshell average blue-green chroma was increased by antioxidant supplementation, although we note that there had already been a pre-existing bias in plasma antioxidant capacity between the supplemented and control groups. Eggshell average blue-green chroma was positively related to female body condition during egg laying. However, blue-green eggshell colour was not related to female oxidative status during or after the laying period, and blue-green chroma increased with laying order. Accordingly, we found some support for that eggshell blue-green colour could reflect maternal antioxidant availability and body condition, but did not find evidence that it has a cost for the female√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s oxidative status. By contrast, eggshell spot brightness was positively related to body condition, suggesting that darker spotting reflected poorer nutritional condition in the canary. Eggshell blue-green pigmentation was not significantly connected to the egg volume or yolk antioxidant level, but we found that eggs with lower yolk antioxidant concentration had higher average eggshell brown chroma. In sum, our results suggest that eggshell colour reflected female antioxidant and nutrient availability. Finally, we found that eggs with thinner eggshells had a more aggregated spot distribution, supporting the view that aggregated spots may help to strengthen eggshells. Significance statement: Avian eggs have a large variability in colours and patterns, which are due to two pigments: the blue-green biliverdin and the red-brown protoporphyrin. In this study, we tested whether eggshell pigmentation, measured by a spectrophotometer, could reflect female and egg quality in the canary, an open nesting songbird. We found that females supplemented with antioxidants before and during egg-laying laid more intense blue-green eggs. Females in better body condition laid eggs that had a more intense blue-green coloration, but lower intensity of brown coloration. Egg yolk antioxidant level was lower in eggs with more intense brown eggshell coloration. These results suggest that eggshell coloration could reflect the antioxidant and nutrient availability of females. Moreover, we found that eggs with thinner eggshells had a more aggregated spot distribution on the eggshell, supporting the view that aggregated brown pigment spots may help to strengthen eggshells. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",74,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

This decline includes passerine populations and one of the mechanisms that may be contributing toward this may be increased nest predation. ground covers are agri-environmental measures whose objective is to halt the loss of biodiversity by creating high-quality habitat patches embedded in a homogeneous landscape by maintaining herbaceous ground cover within crops. however, although such patches are selected by breeding birds, they may also attract predators, and an increased nest density in small habitat patches would thus result in increased predation rates. We have therefore performed nest predation experiments with artificial nests in order to investigate whether the effect of ground cover on nest predation is density dependent. The experiments were carried out during the breeding season in 2014, in two areas of olive groves in southern Spain. We used two nest density levels, both in olive groves with ground cover and in those where the ground was bare. A total of 420 nests were placed, 226 of which (53.81\%) suffered predation. Our results showed that 1) nest predation was density dependent in olive groves with ground cover only with respect to tree nests, while there was no density-dependent predation in bare-ground olive groves of either ground-based or tree nests, and 2) artificial nests placed on the ground were more frequently depredated (65\%) than those placed in trees (29\%), irrespective of either the presence of vegetation cover or nest density. This study suggests that variations in patterns of nest predation are determined by the identity of nest predators and their specific foraging behaviours in different landscapes and habitats.

However, in most studies the exact amount of light at night individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects, e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of light at night.",76,1,"excluded","duplicate"

Such exposure can occur in the tailings ponds of the mineable oil sands, which are located in Alberta, Canada, under a major continental flyway for waterfowl.

This new insight creates an urgent need for more information on the sublethal effects on birds from non-bitumen toxicants that occur in the water, including naphthenic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and salts. Ten studies have addressed the effects of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), and none reported acute or substantial adverse health effects. Interpretive caution is warranted, however, because nine of the studies addressed reclaimed wetlands that received OSPW, not OSPW ponds per se, and differences between experimental and reference sites may have been reduced by shared sources of pollution in the surrounding air and water. Two studies examined eggs of birds nesting >100 km from the mine sites. Only one study exposed birds directly and repeatedly to OSPW and found no consistent differences between treated and control birds in blood-based health metrics. If it is true that aged forms of OSPW do not markedly affect the health of birds that land briefly on the ponds, then the extensiveness of current bird-deterrent programmes is unwarranted and could exert negative net environmental effects.

Observational, comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to identify parasitic eggs (egg-nest contrast hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally test whether egg-nest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two colours: orange and green. Contrary to the egg-nest contrast hypothesis, host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn, experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg rejection rate.

The termite nest was characterized by off-line pyrolysis GC/MS (py-GC/MS), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Pyrolysis of the adsorbent produced a complex mixture of aromatic compounds, including the guaiacyl and syringilic derivatives that are characteristic of lignocellulosic materials. Infrared spectroscopy revealed deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group of the biomass with increasing pH, which was associated with a decrease in the capacity for adsorption of Cr(VI). The EPR g-factor for the termite nest samples varied between 2.0037 and 2.0038, indicating the presence of organic free radicals that were responsible for the redox reaction. A second line with g-factor values of 1.9790, only observed for the samples after contact with Cr(VI) solutions at different pH values, was assigned to Cr(III)-Cr(III) exchange coupled pairs, which explained the capacity of the adsorbent to retain a large portion of the Cr(III) ions produced after reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).

All factors had a significant effect on the phenolic content of a `cup-of-tea' strength rooibos infusion. In particular, infusions prepared from the grade A (highest quality) samples contained a higher content of almost all phenolic compounds than the lower quality plant material. The variations of the content of isoorientin and orientin in the different quality grade infusions over production seasons are larger than the variations in the content of aspalathin and quercetin-3-O-robinobioside. Ferulic acid can be used as an indicator of the quality of rooibos tea as its content generally decreases with increasing tea quality. Steam pasteurization decreased the content of the majority of phenolic compounds in a `cup-of-tea' strength rooibos infusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here we suggest that these relationships and the signal function of eggshell coloration would affect the outcome of coevolution between avian brood parasites and their hosts in at least three different non-exclusive evolutionary pathways. First, by laying blue-green coloured eggs, cuckoo females may exploit possible sensory biases of their hosts, constraining the evolution of parasitic egg recognition, and thus avoid rejection. Second, because of the relatively high costs of laying blue eggs, cuckoo females may be limited in their ability to mimic costly blue-green eggs of their hosts because cuckoo females lay many more eggs than their hosts. Furthermore, costs associated with foreign egg recognition errors would be relatively higher for hosts laying blue eggs. Third, cuckoos may use coloration of host eggs for selecting individuals or specific hosts of appropriate phenotypic quality (i.e. parental abilities). We here explored some predictions emerging from the above scenarios and found partial support for two of them by studying egg coloration of European cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and that of their 25 main hosts, as well as parasitism and rejection rate of hosts. Cuckoo hosts parasitized with more blue, green, and ultraviolet cuckoo eggs, or those laying more blue-green eggs, were more prone to accept experimental parasitism with artificial cuckoo eggs. In addition, coloration of cuckoo eggs is more variable when parasitizing hosts laying bluer-greener eggs, even after controlling for the effect of host egg coloration (i.e. degree of egg matching). Globally, our results are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that host egg traits that are related to phenotypic quality of hosts, such as egg coloration, may have important implications for the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and brood parasites.

Egg recognition in most open-nesting hosts seems to be based entirely on differences in colour. However, hole- and dome-nesting hosts may rely largely on luminance contrasts. Here, we studied egg rejection behaviour in nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos), an open-nesting species that nests in deeply shadowed positions and lays very specific dark olive-green eggs. Although being theoretically suitable as hosts of the cuckoo, nightingales are very rarely parasitized and no cuckoo egg morph mimicking nightingale eggs is known. Thus, we predicted high rejection rate of foreign eggs, but because of the dim nesting environments, luminance contrasts would be an important cue in egg rejection decisions, similar to cavity- or dome-nesting species. We experimentally parasitized nightingale nests with two groups of model egg types: bright eggs and dark eggs. Within each group, one of the egg types was an effective match while the other type was a poor colour match (whitish vs. pale blue and olive-green vs. black).We used a discrimination visual model to quantify host-model egg similarity and compared egg rejection predicted by the model with the observed rejection pattern. Consistent with a scenario of largely luminance-based egg recognition, blue and white eggs, which had larger achromatic mismatching, were rejected at a higher relative rate than the better achromatic matching black and green eggs. Nightingales showed strong aggression to a cuckoo dummy, suggesting that they were involved in coevolutionary interactions with the cuckoo in the past. However, because of the highly distinct appearance of nightingale eggs relative to the other sympatrically breeding passerines, and the largely luminance-based egg recognition, this arms race was likely terminated at an early stage.",107,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

This is crucial for longlived species, where increased parental effort in current reproduction profoundly affects future reproduction. Indication of reproductive value or willingness to invest in reproduction may promote matching responses by mates, thus reducing the conflict over care. In birds with biparental care, blue-green eggshell color may function as a signal of reproductive value that affects parental effort, as predicted by the signaling hypothesis of blue-green eggshell coloration. However, this hypothesis has not been explored during incubation, when the potential stimulus of egg color is present, and has been little studied in longlived birds. We experimentally studied if egg color affected incubation patterns in the blue-footed booby, a longlived species with biparental care and blue eggs. We exchanged fresh eggs between nests of the same laying date and recorded parental incubation effort on the following 4 days. Although egg color did not affect male effort, original eggshell color was correlated with pair matching in incubation. Exchanged eggshell color did not affect incubation patterns. This suggests that biliverdin-based egg coloration reflects female quality features that are associated with pair incubation effort or that blue-footed boobies mate assortatively high-quality pairs incubating more colorful clutches. An intriguing possibility is that egg coloration facilitates an equal sharing of incubation, the signal being functional only during a short period close to laying. Results also suggest that indication of reproductive value reduces the conflict over care. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",119,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants used by blue tits affect the growth and condition of nestlings. Because we expected the effects of plants to depend on environmental conditions, we tested this hypothesis both in enlarged and in control broods.

Following establishment, increased resource availability may also facilitate the spread of exotic plant species if it enhances their competitive abilities relative to native species. Exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) introduce both exotic grass seed and nutrients to an endangered plant community on the Gulf Islands of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. I used greenhouse experiments to assess the competitive advantage of the exotic grasses relative to native and exotic forbs in this community and to test the impacts of nutrient addition from goose feces on competitive outcomes. I grew experimental communities varying in their proportion of forbs versus exotic grasses, and added goose feces as a nutrient source. I found that both native and exotic forbs produced significantly more biomass in competition with conspecifics than in competition with the grasses, and that the proportional abundance of two out of three native forbs was lowest in the combined presence of exotic grasses and nutrient addition. In a second experiment, I found that in monoculture all species of forbs and grasses showed equal growth responses to nutrients. The exotic species did not convert additional nutrients into additional biomass at a higher rate, but did germinate earlier and grow larger than the native species regardless of nutrient availability. This suggests that the exotic species may have achieved their competitive advantage partly by pre-empting resources in community mixtures. Small and late-germinating native forbs may be particularly vulnerable to competitive suppression from exotic grasses and forbs and may be at an even greater disadvantage if their competitors are benefiting from early access to additional nutrients. In combination, the input of exotic propagules and additional nutrients by nesting geese may compromise efforts to maintain native community composition in this system. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",126,2,"excluded","Not birds"

The most frequently studied selective forces moulding egg colouration-predation and brood parasitism-have either received little empirical support or may play a role in only a minority of species. A novel hypothesis has suggested that egg colour may be significantly influenced by sexual selection. Females may deposit a blue-green pigment biliverdin into eggshells instead of using it for themselves as a powerful antioxidant. By this handicap, females may signal their quality to males, which are then hypothesized to increase their paternal effort. We experimentally tested the hypothesis in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a species laying blue-green eggs. We cross-fostered clutches between nests to disentangle effects of female/territory quality and egg colour on paternal effort and nestling quality. The results supported two assumptions of sexual signalling through egg colour hypothesis: Blue pigment seems to be a limited resource for females, and female quality is positively correlated with the intensity of the blue-green colour. However, we did not find support for the main prediction of the hypothesis, as male parental effort parameters (feeding frequencies to nestlings and intensity of nest defence) were unrelated to egg colour. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and previous correlative analyses that supported the hypothesis that blue egg colour may be a postmating, sexually selected signal in females. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",136,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

It has been suggested that it reduces the number of ectoparasites in nests and on nestlings (nest protection hypothesis), or is used by males to signal condition and paternal quality (male quality hypothesis) or is used as a sexually selected ornament to attract females (courtship hypothesis). We simultaneously tested these three hypotheses in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, in the field. Green material was carried by male starlings only, and mainly during nest building. It was not used to reduce ectoparasites. Males nesting in nestboxes that were experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more green nest material than males nesting in control boxes, and experimental removal and addition of green material had no effect on the number of ectoparasites on the nestlings or on their body mass. Furthermore, the amount of green material carried into a nestbox was not associated with male body mass, paternal incubation attendance or nestling food provisioning. There is two-fold experimental evidence that males use green plant material to attract mates. First, removal of greenery resulted in a significantly lower percentage of nestboxes containing a clutch than the control or addition treatment. Second, unpaired male starlings sang more and carried more greenery into a nestbox when a caged female was positioned adjacent to the nestbox than when a caged male or an empty cage was present. Paired males, when subjected to the same experimental design, did not respond. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

If there is a cost associated with reduced male parental care, the relative benefit of mate attraction may be predicted to decrease as the size of a male's clutch or brood increases. We tested this prediction in monogamous pairs of facultatively polygynous European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). The larger the clutch, the more time the male spent incubating and the less time he spent attracting an additional female (i.e. singing near and carrying green nesting material into adjacent empty nest-boxes). Reduced paternal incubation resulted in lower overall incubation (the female did not compensate) and lower hatching success. Immediately after experimental reduction of clutches, males spent significantly less time incubating and more time singing and carrying greenery, and vice versa for experimentally enlarged clutches. Males with experimentally reduced clutches attracted a second female more often than males with experimentally enlarged clutches. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide experimental evidence for an adjustment of paternal care and male mate-attraction effort to clutch size. However, a trade-off between paternal nestling provisioning and mate attraction was not revealed, probably due to the absence of unpaired females by that time in the breeding season.

Although above- and belowground biota can both cause such mosaics, few studies have addressed their interacting effects. We studied multi-trophic interactions between aboveground vertebrate grazers, subterranean ants, plant-pathogenic soil biota (especially nematodes) and the vegetation in a temperate grassland. We found that when rabbits and cattle locally omit vegetation patches, yellow ants (Lasius flavus) respond to the taller vegetation by digging up more sand from deeper soil layers (hence making taller nest mounds), probably to maintain sufficiently high soil temperatures. We found that this ant digging affects other soil biota, as the mounds contain fewer plant-parasitic and fungivore nematodes. Also, the mounds have lower moisture content and soil bulk densities, and higher pH and available nutrient content than the directly surrounding soil. The clonal sedge Carex arenaria grows Vigorously on the mounds, producing more shoots and shorter rhizome internode lengths than in surrounding vegetation. Other plant species, such as the grass Festuca rubra, dominate the surrounding vegetation. A greenhouse bioassay experiment revealed that harmful soil organisms (as plant-parasitic nematodes and pathogenic fungi) outweighed the effect of beneficial organisms (e.g., mycorrhizae) in this system. Rhizome biomass and shoot production of C. arenaria were indeed inhibited less by biota in soil from ant mounds than by biota in soil from the surrounding vegetation. However, the total biomass production of C. arenaria was inhibited as strongly in both soil types. F. rubra was inhibited more strongly by biota in the surrounding soil.

The natural living-space of wildlife is shrinking due to human activities. 70\% of the hunting areas are cultivated today. The majority of wild animals is squeezed into the plough-lands, where they are threatened not only by harvesters and mowers, but also by the adverse effects of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. The experiment was aimed at modelling the effects of NIKROL - UAN solution on chick embryos. In alfalfa-fields different solutions of NIKROL are used for manuring: concentrated solution for basic fertilization, 50\% solution for mulching and 20\% solution for foliar fertilization. The time of foliar fertilization coincides with the egg-laying and hatching period of pheasants and partridges, thus endangering the reproductive success of these species. In the experiment the effects of different NIKROL - UAN solutions (concentrated, 50\%, 20\%, 1\%) on embryonic development were determined. Main results: Concentrated, 50\% and 20\% solutions of NIKROL injected into the eggs caused 87-96\% embryonic mortality right after treatment. Embryomortality slightly decreased (27-80\%) when eggs were immersed in the solutions, but still was dose-dependent. 29 different morphological deformities were detected of which the most frequent ones were stunted growth (16\%) and cyst over the embryo (14\%). Statistical analysis showed that in the second 5 days of incubation NICROL did not influence the weight gain of living embryos when eggs were immersed in the solutions. NIKROL - UAN solution proved to be dangerous to small games nestling in alfalfa- and winter-cereal fields. This fact calls for the extention of research on the postembryonic development of birds, and other animal species (deer, rabbit, etc.). Neglecting fertilization is inconceivable these days, bur the application of fertilizers should be carried out with circumspection. In order to protect birds foliar fertilization should be completed at a time not coinciding with the egg-laying and hatching period.

Experienced predators equally attacked white and non-white butterflies, and the order of attack among the Pieridae was random.

Protonation and deprotonation reactions at these sites promote the trapping of electrons and holes, thereby inhibiting further migration. The extent of migration determines the final distribution of damage in irradiated DNA. In this study, electron and hole migration is investigated in a crystalline DNA hexamer intercalated with an anthracycline drug. The intercalator is no further than 2 base pairs away from any DNA base. From EPR measurements, there is no evidence of DNA-centered radicals in the irradiated DNA hexamer. The aromatic region of the anthracycline intercalator evidently sequesters most or all of the electrons and most of the holes. Further hole trapping and radical stabilization appear to occur on the anthracycline's amino sugar group, which is nestled in the minor groove of the hexamer. The relatively large yield of this proposed amino sugar radical suggests that holes generated in the DNA solvation shell migrate to the amino sugar, where they become trapped. This would be the first observation of a radical formed by the direct effect of low-dose, low-LET radiation that is trapped within the DNA helix, yet lies outside of the stacked bases. With respect to holes generated in the DNA bases at 4 K, we conclude that most, if not all, are capable of migrating to an intercalator less than or equal to 2 base pairs away. With respect to dry electrons, we conclude that anthracycline competes effectively for electron trapping over a region of at least 2 base pairs; our experiments cannot distinguish between electron attachment to the bases followed by transfer to the intercalator and direct attachment to the intercalator.

In such cages the quail hens show symptoms of pre-laying restlessness, The inability to perform normal pre-laying behaviour is regarded as one of the most important problems for the welfare of caged laying hens. The present study aimed at identifying key nest site stimuli for quails, to enable nest boxes to be designed for alternative housing systems. Groups of hens were kept in pens containing litter, nest boxes and dustbathing boxes. The type of nest box was varied between pens, and the incidence of eggs laid outside the nest boxes (floor-eggs) was recorded over periods of 15 days. In experiment 1 (8 groups of 30 hens), both the nature of the top of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) and the type of substrate in the nest boxes (artificial turf or hay) had a significant effect on the percentage of floor-eggs. Nest boxes with a top with slits and filled with hay were best accepted for laying. Nest boxes situated in the corners of the pens were significantly selected more often for egg laying than more central nests. In experiment 2 (8 groups of 14 hens), neither the nature of the sides of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) nor the colour of the nest boxes (green or brown) had a significant effect on the incidence of floor-eggs. In experiment 3 (16 groups of 14 hens with 2 or 3 cocks), the percentage of floor-eggs was significantly lower in pens with high (170 lux) than with low (15 lux) light intensity. There was also a tendency for nest boxes filled with chaff to be better accepted than nest boxes filled with hay. In experiments 2 and 3, in pens with floors half litter and half of perforated plastic more floor-eggs were found on the litter. Few eggs were laid in the dustbathing boxes in any experiment. This study shows that Japanese quail lay up to 90\% of eggs in nest boxes provided these are properly designed. It should therefore be feasible to develop housing systems with nests for Japanese quail which may replace conventional battery cages.

Nestboxes with eggs were installed and their fate was followed for 72 h to determine whether egg destruction and nest site take-overs occurred as predicted by the Egg Protection and Limited Breeding Opportunities Hypotheses, or whether additional eggs appeared in the boxes as predicted by the Brood Parasitism Hypothesis. Eggs were destroyed at 40.6\% of 69 experimental boxes but at only 4.5\% of control nests occupied by laying pairs. No eggs were laid in the experimental boxes. Egg destruction at experimental nests occurred during daylight hours and all mortality was caused by green-rumped parrotlets. Over 75\% of the nests were destroyed by male-female pairs prospecting for nest sites, and the remainder were destroyed by male-male pairs. Lone males never destroyed eggs, although they frequently visited experimental boxes. Two of three failures at control nests were the result of nocturnal predators, and the other nest was apparently destroyed by parrotlets. There was no significant difference between experimental and control boxes in the frequency of visitations by lone males, male-female pairs and male-male pairs. Although experimental boxes that parrotlets visited were discovered quickly after placement, parrotlets were usually slow to enter them ((X) over bar = 5.8 h after discovery, range 0.3-23.5 h). Control nests were rarely left unattended: females spent nearly 75\% of their time in the box, and pairs were typically absent for short intervals (median=7.5 min). Control females responded to intruding parrotlets by remaining in the box 94\% of the time when alone, whereas males actively displaced and chased intruding parrotlets 66\% of the time. Parrotlets that visited control nests approached the box significantly less often than those visiting experimental boxes. To ensure the survival of eggs, parrotlet parents must begin incubating eggs or guarding nests soon after laying to minimize destruction of clutches, loss of nest sites, a decline in the viability of their eggs and the time that all nestlings are exposed to predators.

Hedgerows and meadows were found around all of the nests and most of them were supported by hedgerows, so bullfinches consistently used the general woody vegetation available as reproduction habitat and site. Also, poplar plantations appeared preferentially in the immediate surroundings of the nests. Partly reflecting these results, bullfinches chose zones with greater shrub and tree cover than that available. Bullfinches placed their nests on a wide variety of plant species, but showed predilection for thorny species. Overall mean height of nests above the ground was 1.43 m and large-sized shrubs/trees were preferred. The most predominant bullfinch nest orientations were S, E and centered, which arguably provided thermal benefits and protected from severe weather. In general, there were no significant temporal variations in nest-site selection. With the exception of thorny support and favourable orientation, acting jointly, there was no significant association between nest-site characteristics and nesting success, presumably because many nests were already located in the most advantageous places at each time, and because despite this, predation pressure was high. Nest external dimensions were relatively variable, whereas internal width was the least variable nest dimension. No significant monthly or interannual variations in nest weight were observed. Larger nests did not hold larger clutches. Successful nests were larger than unsuccessful ones. The bullfinch nests were of simple construction, with two clearly different regions, the outer nest and the internal cup, with no significant temporal variations in the weight of either. The outer, structural nest consisted mainly of twigs, whereas roots and herbaceous shoots were the highest fractions lining the cup.

The combined injection of basic fibroblast growth factor and edaravone was conducted to differentiate BMSCs into neuron-like cells. In this study, 120 male Wistar rats were used to establish the model of semitransverse SCI; on the seventh day, neuron-like cells were labeled by BrdU and then injected into the epicenter of the injury of rats. On the 14th day after cell transplantation, the biotin dextran amine (BDA) fluorescent agent was used to track the repair of nerve damage. At 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after SCI, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale method was used to measure the functional recovery of hind limbs in rats. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blotting, and Real-time quantitative reverse transcripion PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to observe the regeneration of nerve cells. In the edaravone+BMSC group, behavioral analysis of locomotor function showed that functional recovery was significantly enhanced after transplantation of the cells, BrdU-positive cells could be observed scattered in the injured area and extended to both the head and tail, and the BDA tracer shows that the edaravone+BMSC group emits more fluorescent signals. Additionally, H&E staining, Nissl staining, and immunohistochemistry revealed that the space of spinal cord tissue was attenuated and the neurons were increased. Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Nestin, and neurofilament 200 (NF) were increased, while the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was decreased. TEM showed that cytoplasmic edema was reduced, mitochondrial vacuoles were attenuated, and nuclear chromatin concentration was declined after transplantation of neuron-like cells. Moreover, with the extension of time of edaravone+BMSC transplantation, the structures of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum tended to be normal. In summary, the induced differentiation of BMSC transplantation can significantly promote the functional repair of SCI. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",196,1,"excluded","Not birds"

We further found that two domains of DEV pUL47, amino acids (aa) 40 to 50 and 768 to 777, could function as nuclear localization sequence (NLS) to guide the nuclear localization of pUL47 and nuclear translocation of heterologous proteins, including enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and beta-galactosidase (√É≈Ω√Ç¬≤-Gal).

An appropriate combination of biomaterials and bioactive substances is currently thought to be a promising approach to treat this condition. Systemic administration of valproic acid (VPA) has been previously shown to promote functional recovery in animal models of SCI. In this study, VPA was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microfibers by the coaxial electrospinning technique. Fibers showed continuous and cylindrical morphology, randomly oriented fibers, and compatible morphological and mechanical characteristics for application in SCI. Drug-release analysis indicated a rapid release of VPA during the first day of the in vitro test. The coaxial fibers containing VPA supported adhesion, viability, and proliferation of PC12 cells. In addition, the VPA/PLGA microfibers induced the reduction of PC12 cell viability, as has already been described in the literature. The biomaterials were implanted in rats after SCI. The groups that received the implants did not show increased functional recovery or tissue regeneration compared to the control. These results indicated the cytocompatibility of the VPA/PLGA core-shell microfibers and that it may be a promising approach to treat SCI when combined with other strategies. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

The effects of this exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new and control-impact radiation treatment is used. In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme.

Both natural fluctuations in environmental conditions and habitat management measures can temporarily cause adverse environmental effects. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the invasive parasitic fly Philornis downsi, control of invasive plants and precipitation on the breeding success of Darwin's finches. Introduced plant species have invaded a unique forest on the Galapagos island of Santa Cruz, which is a key habitat for Darwin's finches. The Galapagos National Park Directorate applies manual control and herbicides to combat this invasion. We hypothesized that these measures led to a reduction in the arthropod food supply during chick rearing, which in turn caused mortality in chicks that were already weakened by parasitism. We compared food availability in three study sites of varying degrees of weed management. To assess the interaction of parasitism and weed management, we experimentally reduced P. downsi abundance in nests in all three study sites. The key result suggests that there is an increase in the adverse effect of parasitism under unfavourable habitat conditions. As predicted, we found a negative additive effect of parasitism and weed management on the breeding success of the insectivorous warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea), but not on the omnivorous small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus), which was strongly affected by parasitism independently of weed management. Management measures can temporarily decrease environmental quality and reduce resistance/tolerance to invasive species.

In this regard, the oilseed crop √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìsesame√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ which is a common annual host of phytoplasma and generally shows symptoms of phyllody on infection, was selected for the study.

Phytoplasma was initially detected using nested-PCR and transmission electron microscopy. A TaqMan based qPCR assay was then performed to detect and understand the in planta distribution of phytoplasma in sesame under field conditions. Results revealed a wide range of phytoplasma titer across the organs of phyllody affected sesame plants i.e. 22 cells to 4.2 √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù 107 cells/√É≈Ω√Ç¬ºg plant DNA. The lowest titer was observed in the roots, whereas the maximum number of phytoplasma cells was observed in the leaves. Phytoplasma concentration positively correlated with disease severity during the initial three stages of disease progression; however, a decline was observed at a later stage. In addition, significant variation was observed in the upper and lower plant parts,and the pattern showed a reversal with respect to early and late stages of disease. The study indicates that the lower plant parts of sesame are advantageous for phytoplasma detection at early stages. However, for experiments with pre-requisite of high phytoplasma abundance, leaves from later stages of phyllody will be beneficial. The outcomes will prove useful in effective sampling of sesame tissues for research and quarantine purposes. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of the in planta distribution of phytoplasma in an annual indeterminate crop plant. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",213,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Our study species, the European starling, includes in its nest aromatic herbs which promote offspring fitness. We provided wild starlings with artificial nests including or excluding the typically selected fresh herbs and found strong support for our prediction of facilitated incubation. Herb effects were not explained by thermal changes of the nests per se, but by modified parental behaviours. Egg temperatures and nest attendancewere higher in herb than herbless nests, egg temperatures dropped less frequently below critical thresholds and parents started their active day earlier. These effects were dynamic over time and particularly strong during early incubation. Incubation period was shorter in herb nests, and nestlings were heavier one week after hatching. Aromatic herbs hence influenced incubation in beneficial ways for offspring, possibly through pharmacological effects on incubating parents. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Alginate increased N2-fixation, though there was no observed S. foliosa growth response.

Immune cells and endogenous SC-neural stem cells (SC-NSCs) play a critical role in wound healing processes, although both are ineffective to completely restore tissue functioning. The role of SC-NSCs in SCI and, in particular, whether such cells can interplay with the immune response are poorly investigated issues, although mechanisms governing such interactions might open new avenues to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Methods: We used two transgenic mouse lines to trace as well as to kill SC-NSCs in mice receiving SCI. We used Nestin CreERT2 mice to trace SC-NSCs descendants in the spinal cord of mice subjected to SCI. While mice carrying the suicide gene thymidine kinase (TK) along with the GFP reporter, under the control of the Nestin promoter regions (Nestin TK mice) were used to label and selectively kill SC-NSCs. Results: We found that SC-NSCs are capable to self-activate after SCI. In addition, a significant worsening of clinical and pathological features of SCI was observed in the Nestin TK mice, upon selective ablation of SC-NSCs before the injury induction. Finally, mice lacking in SC-NSCs and receiving SCI displayed reduced levels of different neurotrophic factors in the SC and significantly higher number of M1-like myeloid cells. Conclusion: Our data show that SC-NSCs undergo cell proliferation in response to traumatic spinal cord injury. Mice lacking SC-NSCs display overt microglia activation and exaggerate expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The absence of SC-NSCs impaired functional recovery as well as neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell survival. Collectively our data indicate that SC-NSCs can interact with microglia/macrophages modulating their activation/responses and that such interaction is importantly involved in mechanisms leading tissue recovery. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2018 The Author(s).",217,1,"excluded","Out of field"

Declines are often attributed to low breeding success, with agricultural intensification and increased clutch predation quoted as causal factors. Conservation measures to improve breeding habitat have included raising water tables and creating a more diverse sward structure. The latter is often achieved by managing the encroachment of Soft Rush Juncus effusus. We review the literature on wader breeding habitat and consider how rush may be best managed to improve sward structure for waders. Rushes can provide cover for both nests and chicks, but, depending on species-specific requirements, may, if too dense, reduce both nesting and foraging opportunities. Rushes can be managed mechanically by cutting, chemically using herbicides, or by manipulating the timing and intensity of grazing by livestock. For cutting to have maximal effect on reduction of rush biomass and regrowth, the cut should be as short as possible and repeated or combined with livestock grazing, especially that by native breeds. However, some areas of rush should either be left uncut or regrowth timed to offer foraging and sheltering opportunities for waders. The optimal size and pattern of such areas, together with rush regrowth rates following treatment requires further research. Herbicides should only be applied using a weed wiper that allows precise application, thus avoiding impacting upon non-target vegetation and possible run-off into water sources. Sward management should be conducted outside the period April to June to avoid disrupting breeding birds. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2019, International Wader Study Group, All right reserved.",218,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Sustainable forest management such as close-to-nature silviculture is needed. In this context forest management practices should be tested in regard to biodiversity. Therefore, we investigated the influence of gap formation and logging intensity on different functional groups in a close-to-nature managed fir-beech forest. Plots were selected in three areas in the Dinaric Mountains in Slovenia. In every area, nine plots were selected per area, of which three were established as control plots, three were treated with 50% logging and three with 100% logging. In every plot, the species of different functional groups were observed: ectomycorrhizal fungi, ferns, graminoids, forbs, hoverflies, carabid beetles and birds. For each of these groups, the species richness, species assemblage dissimilarity and indicator species were calculated for the different treatments. Ectomycorrhizal fungi and birds both responded to high logging intensity with a sharp decrease in the number of species; however, the results for ectomycorrhizal fungi were highly nested, while some additional bird species appeared. Graminoids and forbs were positively affected by logging intensity and saw increases in the number of species. Forbs had an almost completely new species assemblage compared to the forest species assemblages. Hoverflies were most favored by 50% logging, as these plots contained species from open areas and forest. Ferns and carabid beetles did not exhibit a response to different logging intensities. The number of indicator species was highly affected by the total number of species of the groups. However, which treatment they indicated was independent of the species richness but varied strongly per species group. The variability in responses shows that functional groups react differently to logging intensities, and the use of more functional groups improved the detection of changes due to logging. Fifty percent removal of the growing stock retained the diversity of most of the studied groups. The association of the group to vegetation structure, host species specificity or abiotic factors made them more responsive to the change associated with retention logging.

This study explored the hypothesis that they also serve as reservoirs of invertebrate natural enemies whose services extend to suppress pests in adjacent mowed turf. We used vacuum sampling, pitfall traps, and ant baits to compare arthropod populations in grassland or meadow-type naturalized roughs and traditional mowed roughs at two courses, and tested for spillover of biological control using sentinel eggs or larvae of a grass-feeding caterpillar exposed near or farther from naturalized areas into mowed turf. Although some natural enemies (e.g., spiders) were more abundant in naturalized roughs, we saw no direct spillover of predation which was quite high regardless of habitat type. Most likely that is because ground-nesting ants (Lasius, Solenopsis, and Pheidole spp.), which are dominant predators in this system, were equally or more abundant in the mowed turfgrass. Herbivorous insects, too, were more abundant in naturalized roughs, so prey availability may discourage solitary ground-dwelling predators from leaving those refuges to forage in mowed areas. There was no parasitism of sentinel eggs or larvae in our trials. Despite absence of direct spillover of predation, we argue that naturalized roughs might be more purposely designed and managed to promote parasitoids, insectivorous birds, and other enemies that provide diffuse biological control services elsewhere on the course. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",231,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2016 Ruiz-Castellano et al.

Egg and larval production did not differ between experimental colonies after 5 mo. Aril-fed larvae, however, grew 3.5 times larger than those in control colonies. Essential fatty acids in the arils possibly account for improved larval development. Consumption of lipid-rich arils may be critical under scarcity of arthropod prey. Improved larval development through aril consumption confirms that this ant-seed interaction is facultatively mutualistic. This result is meaningful given the predominantly carnivorous diet of O. chelifer, and the generalized nature of ant-seed/fruit interactions in tropical forests. Whether or not benefits to larvae translate into significant gains for ant colonies is uncertain. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Cambridge University Press 2014.",249,1,"excluded","Not birds"

In contrast, a reciprocal transplant experiment was used to investigate the in situ adaptive response of the elevationally widespread epiphytic fern Asplenium antiquum to simulated climate change conditions. Fern spores were collected at three elevations and germinated in a greenhouse. The sporelings (juvenile ferns) were reciprocally transplanted to each collection site. Growth and mortality rates were monitored for 2 years. Wild sporelings were monitored at two sites to assess possible transplant effects. Habitat suitability, indicated by overall growth and survival patterns, declined as elevation increased. Only the highland population showed significant adaptation to the """"home"""" habitat, achieving the highest survival rates. Microclimate data suggest that the presumed genetic adaptation at the highland site occurred mainly in response to drought stress in winter. Based on our previous study on species distribution models, which projected an expansion in the range of A. antiquum under future climate change scenarios, the populations at the upper margins of the species' elevational range may play an important role during this expansion, given their better adaptation to the shifting marginal conditions. Our study suggests that intraspecific variation should be considered when determining the potential impact of climate change on biodiversity. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",254,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Current pharmacologic treatments such as analgesics may improve pain relief but do not alter OA disease progression. Prolonged consumption of these drugs can result in severe adverse effects. Given the nature of OA, life-long treatment will likely be required to arrest or slow its progression. Consequently, there is an urgent need for OA disease-modifying therapies which also improve symptoms and are safe for clinical use over long periods of time.

However, direct environmental stimuli such as temperature, rainfall, or availability of food are thought to be important for fine-tuning breeding activities. Building on evidence from wild Island canaries (Serinus canaria), the authors had shown advancing effects of green vegetation on breeding under captive, short-day conditions. So far, the precise, sensory modalities of this stimulatory cue are unknown. Here the authors present new data that confirm advanced breeding activities in the presence of green vegetation and narrow its stimulatory components. They found that direct exposure of the birds to fresh green vegetation represented the strongest stimulus and advanced breeding by up to 2 months compared to controls. In contrast, access to artificial green vegetation, extracts from green vegetation, or olfactory components alone had no such effects. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first experiment that examines sensory components of an effective, supplementary, non-photoperiodic cue in a temperate zone species. The data suggest that in order to use non-photoperiodic information to time breeding, birds must be able to integrate and process multisensory stimuli. Single non-photoperiodic sensory cues are insufficient to affect the timing of seasonal breeding. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2011 SAGE Publications.",273,1,"excluded","No green nest material

Fire suppression has reduced or eliminated fire and has caused extensive changes in plant community composition and structure. The National Fire and Fire-Surrogate study was implemented to evaluate effects of alternative habitat treatments, such as herbicide application and mechanical thinning, and to compare them with effects of prescribed fire. We evaluated how treatments influenced the nesting success of birds breeding in 10-ha plots of longleaf pine at Solon Dixon Experimental Forest, Alabama. We measured daily rates of nest mortality for 432 nests of 33 species in unmanipulated (controls), burned, herbicide-treated and burned, thinned, and thinned and burned plots during the three years of our study. Although we accumulated observations of 6,624 days that nests were exposed to possible predation, sample sizes were still too small to permit robust statistical analyses of treatment effects. Data from one (Eastern Towhee, Pipilo erythrophthalmus) of two species with the largest sample sizes suggested that nests in treatment plots experienced higher rates of mortality than did nests in control plots, but sample sizes were still small enough that high estimates of variance prevented strong statistical evaluation. Nest survival for the other common species, Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), showed no such suggestive differences. We present results from all nests of all species for which we found three or more nests so that future researchers can use the data during meta-analyses. We also encourage those designing future similar studies to consider expanding the size of study plots so that at least the most numerous open-cup nesting birds can be found in sufficient numbers for strong statistical analyses. In longleaf pine forests of southern Alabama, we estimate that minimum plot sizes would need to be 50 ha for the two most common species, Eastern Towhee and Northern Cardinal. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Robinson and Rompr√É∆í√Ç¬©; Licensee Bentham Open.",280,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Despite its wide use as an NPC marker, the function of nestin in embryo development is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: As nestin is conserved in zebrafish and its predicted sequence is clustered with the mammalian nestin orthologue, we used zebrafish as a model to investigate its role in embryogenesis. Injection of nestin morpholino (MO) into fertilized eggs induced time- and dose-dependent brain and eye developmental defects. Nestin morphants exhibited characteristic morphological changes including small head, small eyes and hydrocephalus. Histological examinations show reduced hind- and mid-brain size, dilated ventricle, poorly organized retina and underdeveloped lens. Injection of control nestin MO did not induce brain or eye changes. Nestin MO injection reduced expression of ascl1b (achaete-scute complex-like 1b), a marker of NPCs, without affecting its distribution. Nestin MO did not influence Elavl3/4 (Embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like 3/4) (a neuronal marker), or otx2 (a midbrain neuronal marker), but severely perturbed cranial motor nerve development and axon distribution. To determine whether the developmental defects are due to excessive NPC apoptosis and/or reduced NPC proliferation, we analyzed apoptosis by TUNEL assay and acridine orange staining and proliferation by BrdU incorporation, pcna and mcm5 expressions. Excessive apoptosis was noted in hindbrain and midbrain cells. Apoptotic signals were colocalized with ascl1b. Proliferation markers were not significantly altered by nestin MO. Conclusion/Significance: These results suggest that nestin is essential for zebrafish brain and eye development probably through control of progenitor cell apoptosis. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2010 Chen et al.",285,1,"excluded","Not birds"

The study suggested that the polysaccharide of this fungus has the antibacterial activity. C. stercoreus was selected to green house study. Water extract filtrate of raw wheat straw (wers) and of spent mushroom straw (wess) of three Pleurotus sp. were tested to inhibit R. solanacearum growth by applying disc-filter paper method. RSE filtrate and all the other three filtrates inhibited R. solanacearum growth. Water extract of Pleurotus columbinus spent wheat straw (wess) had the largest inhibition zone, so, it was selected to further study. In greenhouse experiment, the previous selected factors were used to estimate their ability to biocontrol R. solanacearum. The reported results revealed that the mycelial suspension of C. stercoreus (Css) had the best effect in reduction of the disease, plant health and plant production. Consequently, this is the first report of using C. stercoreus in biological control of plant diseases. Using of spent straw and raw straw powders and their water extracts had good results in controlling the disease and plant productivity. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",300,1,"excluded","Not birds"

To achieve this goal, we generated a line of transgenic rats expressing a bacterial enzyme, Escherichia coli nitroreductase gene (NTR), under control of the nestin promoter. In this system, NTR+ cells are selectively eliminated upon application of prodrug CB1954, through activation of programmed cell death machineries. At 5 days of age, which is a time when cerebellar development is occurring, transgenic rats bearing the nestin-NTR/green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene are overtly normal and express NTR/GFP in neuronal stem cells, without any toxicity in these cells. The functional consequence of progenitor cell ablation was demonstrated by administering prodrug CB1954 into the cerebellum at this 5-day time point. Stem cell ablation in these neonates resulted in sensorimotor abnormalities, cerebellar degeneration, overall reduction in cerebellar seize, and manifestation of ataxia. In adult rats, GFP expression was not seen in the hippocampal progenitor cells and seen only at very low levels in the lateral ventricles, indicating a different NTR/GFP expression pattern between neonates and adults. In addition, application of CB1954 by intraventricular delivery reduced the number of 5-bromo-2√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬≤-deoxyuridine-labeled proliferating cells in the lateral ventricle but not hippocampus of NTR/GFP rats. These findings shows that targeted expression of NTR under a specific promoter might be of significant value in addressing the function of distinct cell population in vivo. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",304,1,"excluded","Out of field"

The density of herbaceous vegetation increased four- to six-fold in riparian and mesquite grassland communities. Little change occurred in herbaceous vegetation in desert scrub, or in the density of shrubs or trees in any of the communities. Of 61 bird species for which sufficient data were collected, mean detections per kilometer increased for 42 species, 26 significantly, and decreased for 19 species, 8 significantly. The number of individuals of all avian species detected on surveys increased each year from 103/kilometer in 1986 to 221/kilometer in 1991, an average annual increase of 23% (p < 0.001). The largest increases occurred in riparian species, open-cup nesters, Neotropical migrants, and insectivores. Species of the Chihuahuan desert-scrub, in which vegetation changed the least, showed the smallest increases. Only a few of the species showed increasing regional trends for the same period, as demonstrated by the North American Breeding Bird Survey; thus, increases on the San Pedro Riparian NCA were likely caused by the change in local conditions, not by regional effects.

In the case of the former, asymptotic expectations are generally derived (analytically or numerically) from analysis of the potential effects of perturbation of the elements of the life table. However, the vital rates that are indicated by prospective analysis to contribute the most to projected growth rate are not necessarily those that have contributed to observed variation in growth rate over time. We used a retrospective analysis to analyze the life table responses of a population of long-lived herbivorous geese to a systematic reduction in food abundance within the traditional breeding colony. Typical of long-lived species, adult survival rate has been shown previously in a prospective perturbation analysis to have the largest potential impact on projected growth of the population. However, despite a significant long-term increase in adult survival over the course of the study, there has been a long-term decline in growth rates of the population inhabiting the traditional sampling areas, although absolute numbers of individuals in both populations increased over time. Retrospective assessment of the relative contributions of variation in underlying vital rates (adult and juvenile survival, in situ recruitment, emigration and immigration rates into the population) to projected growth showed that the long-term dynamics of the nesting population primarily reflected the combined effects of changes in postfledging juvenile survival, while changes in the postnesting population were most influenced by variation in juvenile survival and adult fidelity rate to the traditional brood-rearing areas. Decreases in both juvenile survival and fidelity reflect systematic reductions in food abundance over the course of the study.

The amino acid sequences at the epitope sites of these anti-Musashi1 Mabs are remarkably conserved among the human, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. Spatiotemporal patterns of Musashi1 immunoreactivity in the developing and/or adult CNS tissues of frogs, birds, rodents, and humans indicated that our anti-Musashi1 Mabs reacted with undifferentiated, proliferative cells in the CNS of all the vertebrates tested. Double or triple immunostaining of embryonic mouse brain cells in monolayer cultures demonstrated strong Musashi1 expression in Nestin(+)/RC2(+) cells. The relative number of Musashi1(+)/Nestin(+)/RC2(+) cells increased fivefold when embryonic forebrain cells were cultured to form 'neurospheres' in which stem-like cells are known to be enriched through their self-renewing mode of growth. Nestin(+)/RC2(-) cells, which included T√É≈Ω√Ç¬±1-GFP(+) neuronal progenitor cells and GLAST(+) astroglial precursor cells, were also Musashi1(+), as were GFAP(+) astrocytes. Young neurons showed a trace of Musashi1 expression. Cells committed to the oligodendroglial lineage were Musashi(-). Musashi1 was localized to the perikarya of CNS stem-like cells and non-oligodendroglial progenitor cells without shifting to cell processes or endfeet, and is therefore advantageous for identifying each cell and counting cells in situ.

Some developments may cause disturbance to wildlife. Knowledge of the way in which species respond to disturbance has been fragmented, yet is an important consideration in environmental impact assessments. This paper reviews what is known about disturbance factors on the best studied group, birds. A set of extensive appendices summarize the literature on disturbance effects on breeding, breeding success, nest-site choice, population density, community structure, distribution and habitat use. The paper considers human-induced disturbance, public access, water-based recreation, shooting and industrial developments. Mitigation measures are discussed. Human-induced disturbance can have a significant negative effect on breeding success by causing nest abandonment and increased predation. Outside the breeding season, recreation (particularly power boating, sailing and coarse fishing on wetlands) reduces the use of sites by birds. Compensatory feeding at night by some species can probably recoup some of the energy losses caused by disturbance. Public and vehicular access to open landscapes has been shown negatively to affect grazing geese in winter and lowland and upland waders during breeding. Shooting disturbance has been shown to be most important for herbivore feeders which need to spend long periods of the day feeding in order to maintain their energy balance, e.g. wigeon. The provision of refuges devoid of shooting has been fundamental in attracting wildfowl away from non-refuge sites. The response of birds to scaring devices and other control measures is discussed. Effects from industrial developments include direct loss of habitat, disturbance through the presence of humans during the construction process and the presence of artificial light used to illuminate construction sites. On estuaries, engineering operations should avoid the proximity to established roost sites of wading birds. A number of studies showed increased vigilance (and hence reduced feeding time) in flock members feeding near structures which impede their vision of the approach of potential predators. A number of principal management techniques used to reduce disturbance on a site, or to attempt to compensate for habitat loss, are given. For wetland sites, these include excavating new shallow lagoons and grading bank sides, flooding of low-lying pasture, reducing salinity levels in coastal lagoons thereby making them more attractive to the birds' food invertebrates, manipulating water levels to expose mud regularly and creating feeding areas for geese and wigeon, using manipulative livestock grazing. Also used are increasing nesting cover, planting macrophytes, providing islands, spits and promontories, purchasing more land to make a refuge bigger, concealing observers with banks and screens, zoning activities and prohibiting access and avoiding the obstruction of flyways between feeding and roosting areas. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 1992, Academic Press Limited.

Detailed evidence has been collected from the following three groups of studies on herring gulls in the lower Great Lakes during the early 1970s; Forster√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s terns in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1983; and double-crested cormorants and Caspian terns in various locations in the upper Great Lakes from 1986 onwards. It has proved difficult to establish not only the onset of the disease in the various species at various locations but also the period in which chick-edema active compounds were released. Anecdotal evidence suggested that serious egg mortality. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 1988 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation.",355,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Choice experiments were conducted with 2 insects and a rodent which consume Cakile at Point Reyes National Seashore, where only C. maritima now occurs. Larvae of the moth Platyprepia virginalis (Arctiidae) displayed a significant preference for foliage of C. maritima in a laboratory test.

Experiments with deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus demonstrated a significant preference for C. edentula seedlings and fruits. Degree of preference by mice for seedlings was affected by distance from the experimental location to patches of introduced beachgrass Ammophilia arenaria, which mice use for nesting sites and cover, but this distance-dependence did not occur for fruit predation. Herbivory by the 2 insect species was not a factor in this case of species replacement. Peromyscus preference for seedlings and fruits of C. edentula would have affected the rapidity of local species replacement at Point Reyes, but this preference does not explain the current distribution of Cakile on the Pacific Coast.

An artificial odorant present during the development of group-reared chicks subsequently proved attractive in an otherwise novel and potentially frightening stiuation. Chicks reared with one of two aromatic oils subsequently discriminated between them and preferred the familiar oil when both were present in the test box. The preferences are likely acquired because naive, one-day-old chicks reacted similarly to wood litter treated with either water or oil. Presence of a familiar rearing odor also reduced fear of a novel open field. In contrast to controls, chicks whose nostrils were blocked prior to rearing with an aromatic oil showed no subsequent preference for this odorant.

Difficulties in the use of Nest Record Cards for this species (to obtain information from more sites) are discussed. Territory sizes tended to be smaller, and more feeding took place within territories, at Lindisfarne than at Mestersvig. Clutch sizes were similar in different areas. Incubation (mean period about 25 days) was shared fairly equally by the two sexes. Longer incubation shifts at Mestersvig and some areas at Lindisfarne than at other Lindisfarne sites were associated with greater distances between nests and feeding areas. Most egg losses were probably due to predation, and were fewer in the Arctic than in Britain, where nesting success varied greatly in different areas and years, and in relation to timing within a season. Up to five nestings per pair per year were made at Lindisfarne, but only one at Mestersvig. The timing of breeding is discussed, and it is concluded that the date of start of egg√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ø¬ø¬Ωlaying in north√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ø¬ø¬Ωeast Greenland is determined by the timing of snow clearance, while that at Lindisfarne is related to the decreasing probability of egg√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ø¬ø¬Ωpredation later in the season. Because of the high nest losses, the production of young at many temperate sites, including parts of Lindisfarne, was probably inadequate for the population to be self√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ø¬ø¬Ωsupporting. The reasons for the large seasonal, annual and geographical differences are discussed. It is concluded that increasing predation probably determines the southern nesting limits of Ringed plovers, but that this limit may be modified by varying degrees of different types of natural and artificial protection, and extent of habitat suitable for egg camouflage. Increased human usage of nesting beaches probably has an adverse effect on nesting success, but because of the complexity of the number of inter√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ø¬ø¬Ωrelated factors affecting the latter, without field experiments it is difficult to predict how this could best be offset by protection measures.

This belief was recently revised by several studies showing that various bird species, including passerines, use olfaction in many respects of life. During courtship and nest building, male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) incorporate aromatic herbs that are rich in volatile compounds (e. g., milfoil, Achillea millefolium) into the nests and they use olfactory cues to identify these plants. Interestingly, European starlings show seasonal differences in their ability to respond to odour cues: odour sensitivity peaks during nest-building in the spring, but is almost non-existent during the non-breeding season. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used repeated in vivo Manganese-enhanced MRI to quantify for the first time possible seasonal changes in the anatomy and activity of the OB in starling brains. We demonstrated that the OB of the starling exhibits a functional seasonal plasticity of certain plant odour specificity and that the OB is only able to detect milfoil odour during the breeding season. Volumetric analysis showed that this seasonal change in activity is not linked to a change in OB volume. By subsequently experimentally elevating testosterone (T) in half of the males during the non-breeding season we showed that the OB volume was increased compared to controls. Conclusions/Significance: By investigating the neural substrate of seasonal olfactory sensitivity changes we show that the starlings' OB loses its ability during the non-breeding season to detect a natural odour of a plant preferred as green nest material by male starlings. We found that testosterone, applied during the non-breeding season, does not restore the discriminatory ability of the OB but has an influence on its size.",4,2,"selected",NA

This behaviour is related to courtship but also benefits the nestlings. We tested in aviary experiments whether males select aromatic plants using olfaction and whether they depend on experience with nest odours they encountered as nestlings. We scented nests of wild starlings with milfoil, Achillea millefolium, a preferred nest plant of the starlings, and other control nests with vanilla. Fledglings from both nest types were hand-reared and tested the following year in dyadic choice experiments for their odour preference. Males from both milfoil- and vanilla-treated nests preferred milfoil scent when they had the choice between milfoil-scented versus vanilla-scented or versus unscented leaves. However, when they had to choose between vanilla scent and no scent, males from vanilla-treated nests chose vanilla scent but males from milfoil-treated nests did not discriminate. The disinterest of vanilla-inexperienced males in vanilla-scented leaves (when milfoil scent was lacking) and the preference for it in vanilla-experienced males implies learning during the nestling period. Because males discriminated between leaves of the same plant species looking the same but scented with different odours and because males without milfoil experience instantly preferred milfoil odour, we conclude that starlings use olfactory cues to select green nest material following an olfactory pattern designed prior to birth which may be supplemented by learning early in ontogeny. √Ç¬© 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",5,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

We performed experiments to test their egg discrimination ability under different light conditions. Our results showed that Green-backed Tits discriminate against non-mimetic foreign eggs under normal light conditions in nest boxes, and this ability persisted at nest luminance as low as 4.78 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ√Ç¬± √¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ1.31 lux that is several times lower than normal luminance (38.11 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ√Ç¬± √¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ24.02 lux).

Exposing an organism to ALAN during its early life could also have an impact on its development. Since photoperiod can trigger or schedule the migration timing of long-distance migratory birds, there is great potential for anthropogenic light to interact with photoperiod to affect timing. However, very little has been investigated regarding the impacts of ALAN on post-hatching development and migration timing. We investigated the impact of ALAN during nestling development in a long-distance migratory songbird to determine the potential impact on the timing of post-breeding movements in the wild. We experimentally manipulated the light by using programmable lighting, in the nest boxes of free-living nestlings of purple martin (Progne subis) in Manitoba, Canada. We exposed two groups of developing nestlings, from hatch to fledge date, to green or white LED lights (5 lux) during the night. We also included a control group that experienced natural, ambient light at night. We found that some adults abandoned their nests shortly after starting the experiment (4 of 15 nests in the white light treatment). For the nests that remained active, nestlings exposed to the white light treatment had higher weights (at day 20 or 22), later fledge dates (1.54 √Ç¬± 0.37, 95% CI 0.80√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2.28), and later colony departure date (2.84 √Ç¬± 1.00, 95% CI 0.88√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú4.81), than young of the control group.

The cort-adaptation hypothesis predicts that baseline concentrations of glucocorticoids are adjusted upward to match energetic needs and promote fitness when individuals are faced with physiological challenges, including those associated with reproduction. We tested the cort-adaptation hypothesis in the violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) by experimentally increasing flight costs during the offspring rearing period. Individual females were assigned to one of three treatments: light feather clipping (removal of four wing feathers), heavy feather clipping (removal of eight wing feathers) or a sham-clip control. We measured baseline corticosterone and body mass immediately prior to implementing treatments during the offspring rearing period and then 10√Ç¬†days after initial manipulations took place. We also quantified risk-taking behaviour, offspring feeding rate and the number of offspring fledged. Finally, we examined how treatments influenced offspring phenotype via measurements of nestling body mass and baseline corticosterone, as both measures have been associated with post-fledging survival. We found that handicapped females significantly increased baseline corticosterone between the two sampling periods, with the magnitude of change in the light clipping and heavy clipping treatments 2√Ç¬∑5√É‚Äî and 6√Ç¬∑1√É‚Äî greater than controls, respectively. All individuals lost mass between the two sampling periods, but the degree of loss was greater for females in both clipping treatments relative to unmanipulated controls. In contrast, we found no evidence of treatment differences in female risk-taking, offspring provisioning or in the number of offspring fledged. Offspring raised by females in both handicapped treatments did have significantly elevated baseline corticosterone relative to those in control broods, but we detected no treatment differences in offspring body mass. Our study found that handicapped females increased circulating glucocorticoids and were able to maintain critical parental care behaviours and raise a similar number of offspring as unmanipulated controls. Thus, increases in baseline cort of handicapped females appeared to have allowed them to maintain fitness despite increased physiological challenges, providing support for the cort-adaptation hypothesis.

Several species of birds regularly introduce aromatic herbs into their nests putatively to reduce parasites. The behaviour is most often seen in cavity nesting birds and after nest building has finished. The plants are included in a non-structural manner and are often strongly aromatic. Various different hypotheses have been proposed regarding the function of this behaviour; from the plants altering some non-living factor in the nest (crypsis, water loss and insulation hypotheses) to them being involved in mate selection (mate hypothesis) or even having a beneficial effect, direct or indirect, on chicks (drug or nest protection hypothesis, NPH). Many studies have been carried out over the years observing and experimentally testing these hypotheses. This review focuses on studies involving the most popular of these hypotheses, the NPH: that plants decrease nest parasites or pathogens, thereby conveying positive effects to the chicks, allowing the behaviour to evolve.

We supplemented roller (Coracias garrulus) nestlings with methionine in a between-nest design to investigate the way in which the sex and position in the hatching hierarchy affect the allocation of resources among growth, immunity, and plumage coloration. Methionine induces the production of lymphocytes at expense of growth; thus, we used it to manipulate growth and immunity, which are two traits likely to compromise plumage coloration. We predicted that late-hatched chicks within a brood (juniors) compared to early-hatched chicks (seniors) should allocate more to traits directly providing fitness than to ornamental traits because juniors are more affected than seniors by sibling competition. The methionine treatment effectively enhanced the production of lymphocytes in experimental broods. This appeared to be at the expense of plumage coloration in junior nestlings because, in supplemented nests, junior males showed a trend to display less greenish bellies than junior males from control nests. However, juniors from supplemented nests maintained wing growth as in control juniors. The plumage coloration of seniors was unaffected by the methionine supplementation, although they paid the costs of lymphocyte production at a level of growth that was reduced compared to senior nestlings in control nests. Hence, sex, and hatching order affected resource allocation among growth, immunity, and plumage coloration of roller nestlings.

Two sites at Edmonson Point were studied: the first was poor in nutrients, near the glacier, and the second was close to bird nesting sites. The highest abundance of soil fungi was recorded at the site adjacent to the bird nesting sites. Phoma herbarum was the most abundant taxon. Lecytophora lignicola and Ascotricha erinacea are new records for continental Antarctica. The fungal assemblage from the nutrient-deficient site was characterized by a dominance-diversity curve approaching the broken-stick model, the assemblage from the soil influenced by birds was characterized by a lognormal distribution. Plastic cloches were used in experiments designed to assess differences in fungal assemblages subjected to altered temperature and/or UV exposure. Dominance-diversity curves and diversity values of soil fungal mycobiota were compared in their natural condition as compared with manipulated conditions. Under the walled cloches, at both sites, artificial warming led to stress on Antarctic soil fungal assemblages. In contrast, UV protection led to a higher equilibrium in the assemblage structure. On the basis of the results obtained, it could be proposed that UV radiation is the most important limiting ecological factor for soil mycobiota in continental Antarctica. √Ç¬© Springer-Verlag 2005.",30,2,"excluded","Not birds"

Mechanisms by which prey coloration provides camouflage has been widely studied. However, predator response to prey camouflage and concealment has received less attention. Understanding vegetation structure effect on depredation success could help managers design strategies to mitigate the depredation of managed species (e.g., threatened or hunted). We aimed to investigate the relationship between depredation rate, nest camouflage and concealment in ground-nesting birds of farmlands, and their predators. We set up an experiment of 2576 artificial ground nests to assess the role of egg coloration (white, light green, and dark green), egg size (small, medium, and large), and vegetation structure (vegetation height and land use) in nest survival rates. We also explored the role of predator searching strategies by analysing clumped depredation and multiple depredation events. Of the nests, 34.0\% were depredated, with corvids as the predators 78.5\% of the time. Corvid depredation decreased by 40-60\% in grasslands and spring crops above a vegetation height of 30 cm. In contrast, vegetation height and land use may be of far less importance in avoiding depredation by other predators. The probability of depredation was spatially clumped, suggesting that predators increase search effort in areas where a nest was previously encountered. Neighboring depredation and depredation repetition were more frequent in corvids than in other predators. Our study indicates that nests in vegetation higher than 30 cm had a drastic reduction in depredation rates by corvids.

Atrazine, a residual herbicide with a wide range of reported environmental impacts, has been extensively applied in agricultural soils cultivated with gramineous crops. While atrazine persistence in soils has been widely studied by quantifying half-life from experimental dissipation curves, the spatial variability of half-life at the landscape scale has not been sufficiently explored. The objectives of this work were to estimate atrazine dissipation in a variety of soils and to map its spatial variability by modelling half-life as a function of environmental variables. Based on laboratory determination and environmental data, atrazine dissipation in soils was mapped across the territory of C√É¬≥rdoba province, central Argentina. First, we determined the dissipation parameters of atrazine under a variety of environmental conditions in 60 sites. Second, we fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model for the estimated atrazine half-lives, considering a soil site-specific property (soil organic carbon, SOC) and land use (gramineous crop, non-gramineous crop, pasture, and forest) as covariates. We used Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and stochastic partial differential equations to model the spatial dependence on random effects. The results suggest that atrazine half-life can be spatially predicted by SOC and land use. Atrazine dissipation was faster in sites with previous gramineous crops and high soil organic matter. The digital map allowed us to quantify the environmental variability of atrazine dissipation in C√É¬≥rdoba (3.2√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú99.5 days).

The existence of niche differentiation is uniquely difficult to prove on account of the fact that historical interaction among species, which plays a key role in elucidating the current state of coexistence among species, is not well known. We created continuous niche gradients in nest-site resources between two sympatric secondary cavity-nesting birds, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus) and the russet sparrow (Passer cinnamomeus), and investigated whether nesting site is a factor contributing to limiting breeding overlap by regular inspection and 388,160√Ç¬†min of film recording. Our results indicate that although we manipulated nest site availability to be uniformly high along the habitat gradient, the two bird species have little overlap in nest sites and rarely compete for them. Furthermore, the green-backed tit possessed a wide range of fundamental niche that covered that of the russet sparrow, while their reproductive time was largely segregated. The sparrow was more aggressive and outcompeted the tit in their overlapped range. These results suggest that even though nesting sites are crucial to the reproduction of cavity-nesting birds, some other factor plays a more important role in limiting niche overlap between sparrows and tits in space and time. Given that these two cavity-nesting birds continued to use different habitats and breed in segregated time after our manipulation, their relationship is better explained by the ghost of competition past theory. √Ç¬© 2019 The Authors.

We used a large-scale experiment to test how nest and post-fledging survival were influenced by herbicide intensity within managed conifer plantations across 2 breeding seasons. We created a gradient of 4 stand-scale herbicide treatments (light, moderate, and intensive, and no-spray control) and evaluated the reproductive response of the White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), a declining songbird in managed forest landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. Against initial predictions, we found no evidence that either daily nest survival (n > 760 nests across all treatments) or post-fledging survival (n = 70 individuals reared in control and moderate treatments) were influenced by herbicide application intensity. Increased herbicide intensity resulted in an extensive reduction in vegetation cover at both stand and nest-patch scales; in contrast, vegetative cover at nest sites did not differ across herbicide treatments, nor was nest survival related to vegetation concealment measures. As the largest experimental investigation to assess forest herbicide effects on songbird demography, our study indicates that components of sparrow reproductive success were not influenced by experimental vegetation control measures, although additional work on other early-successional species will be useful to evaluate the generalities of our findings. √Ç¬© American Ornithological Society 2019.

Widespread, long-term population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have elicited concern about potential negative effects of livestock management practices on sage-grouse populations. We evaluated how recently implemented rotational grazing systems affected sage-grouse nesting habitat quality as part of a large-scale, replicated, natural experiment in central Montana, USA. We used Bayesian methods to assess support for effects of rotational grazing management and rest from grazing on daily survival rates of nearly 500 sage-grouse nests monitored over 6 years, and mixed effects models to test for effects of rotational grazing and rest on vegetation structure. Though nests on rotationally grazed ranches displayed a trend toward greater daily survival rates, the evidence for an effect was weak. There was no evidence that rest from grazing (12 months) increased daily survival rates. Furthermore, rotational grazing systems and rest had negligible effects on herbaceous vegetation height and cover relative to other grazing strategies used in the study area. Results do not support the hypothesis that rotational grazing systems or rest from grazing increase nest success in the northern Great Plains. Estimated nest success, however, was comparable to range-wide averages, suggesting concealing cover for nests is unlikely to be limiting growth of this population regardless of grazing strategy. In light of these results and recent research questioning reported relationships between grass height and nest survival, maximization of hiding cover may be overemphasized in grazing management guidelines and policies. Rather, our findings suggest a variety of locally appropriate grazing strategies focused on fundamental range health principles may provide adequate habitat quality for nesting sage-grouse.

It was found that, in comparison to natural attenuation, bioremediation increased the removal efficiency by 76\% and 65\% for alkanes and aromatics, respectively. Increasing the nutrient concentration in the applied solution did not always enhance biodegradation as oxygen became limiting even when the beach was originally oxygen-rich. Therefore, replenishment of oxygen to oil-contaminated zone was also essential. Stimulation of oil biodegradation was more evident in the upper and midintertidal zone of the beach, and less in the lower intertidal zone. This was due to reduced nutrient and oxygen replenishment, as very little of the amendment solution reached that zone. It was found that under continual application, most of the oil biodegraded within 2 months, while it persisted for 6 months under natural conditions. While the difference in duration suggests minimal long-term effects, there are situations where the beach would need to be cleaned for major ecological functions, such as temporary nesting or feeding for migratory birds. Biochemical retention time map (BRTM) showed that the duration of solution application was dependent upon the stimulated oil biodegradation rate. By contrast, the application rate of the amendment solution was dependent upon the subsurface extent of the oil-contaminated zone.

Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year.

Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity. Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total phenol content).

Three types of artificial nests (cup-shrub, cup-ground and bare-ground) were used along the altitudinal gradient. Overall, elevation had no effect on the daily survival rate (DSR) of the artificial nests. However, there was a significant elevation-nest type interaction.

We tested the effects of the same vegetation parameters (tree density, herb and shrub layer coverage, and canopy openness) on the DSR of different nest types to understand how different vegetation layers or combinations of them affect DSR. Daily survival rate for bare-ground nests significantly decreased with increasing canopy openness, and was positively influenced by coverage of herb layer and tree density. For cup-shrub nests, DSR increased significantly with increasing shrub layer coverage. Finally, for cup-ground nests, we found a positive effect of shrub coverage and canopy openness on DSR.

Little is known about how such changes may affect the belowground community of maize symbionts. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the composition of the indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities colonizing four Popoluca maize landraces and the hybrid Texcoco, and to determine how these communities are influenced by the level of phosphorus fertilization. Fragments of AMF ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were amplified using nested PCR, producing 327 Glomeromycota sequences.

Uropygial secretions also reach eggshells during incubation and, therefore, may influence the coloration of birds' eggs, a trait that has attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists for more than one century. The color of hoopoe eggs typically changes along incubation, from bluish-gray to greenish-brown. Here, we test experimentally the hypothesis that dark uropygial secretion of females is responsible for such drastic color change. Moreover, since uropygial secretion of hoopoes has antimicrobial properties, we also explore the association between color and antimicrobial activity of the uropygial secretion of females. We found that eggs stayed bluish-gray in nests where female access to the uropygial secretion was experimentally blocked. Furthermore, experimental eggs that were maintained in incubators and manually smeared with uropygial secretion experienced similar color changes that naturally incubated eggs did, while control eggs that were not in contact with the secretions did not experience such color changes. All these results strongly support the hypothesis that female hoopoes use their uropygial gland secretion to color the eggs. Moreover, saturation of the uropygial secretion was associated with antimicrobial activity against Bacillus licheniformis. Given the known antimicrobial potential of uropygial secretions of birds, this finding opens the possibility that in scenarios of sexual selection, hoopoes in particular and birds in general signal antimicrobial properties of their uropygial secretion by mean of changes in egg coloration along incubation. √Ç¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",90,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Species and guild responses, in terms of seasonal presence recorded by multiple point counts, were examined using generalized linear mixed models. Several guilds or migrant species responded positively to deer exclusion and none responded negatively. The shrub-layer foraging guild was recorded less frequently in older and browsed vegetation, in both winter and spring. Exclusion of deer also increased the occurrence of ground-foraging species in both seasons, although these species showed no strong response to vegetation age. The canopy-foraging guild was unaffected by deer exclusion or vegetation age in either season. There was seasonal variation in the responses of some individual resident species, including a significantly lower occurrence of Eurasian Wren Troglodytes troglodytes and European Robin Erithacus rubecula in browsed vegetation in winter, but no effect of browsing on those species in spring. Ordinations of bird assemblage compositions also revealed seasonal differences in response to gradients of vegetation structure generated by canopy-closure and exclusion of deer. Positive impacts of deer exclusion in winter are probably linked to reduced thermal cover and predator protection afforded by browsed vegetation, whereas species that responded positively in spring were also dependent on a dense understorey for nesting.

Recent studies focus on the role of eggshell colour as a postmating sexually selected trait of females which manipulates male parental investment. A basic prediction of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers. This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality, females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component.

Nesting attempts can fail for various reasons, and determining risk of failure from specific causes associated with livestock grazing would enhance development of range management practices in areas managed for threatened grassland bird populations. Domestic livestock may influence nest failure by affecting vegetation structure, numerical or functional responses of predators, or directly by trampling nests. We hypothesized stocking rate may influence nest fate because it affects the amount and distribution of remaining vegetation, and the number of large herbivores to which nests are exposed. In 2007 and 2008, we evaluated nest fates for savannah sparrows and horned larks under 4 stocking rates experimentally applied in 40-ha paddocks in northeastern Oregon, USA. In addition to stocking rate, we evaluated variables such as vegetation structure and predator abundance and activity to help clarify mechanisms responsible for nest failure. We used a discrete competing risks framework to estimate daily probability of nest survival and failure from specific causes. These algorithms, implemented in a stand-alone graphical user interface-driven model, allow incorporation of covariates within an information theoretic approach to model inference. Although stocking rate influenced vegetation structure, the only nest failures related to stocking rate were from trampling. Trampling events were too infrequent to test for treatment effects (only 1 nest of each species), but occurred in the moderate and high stocking treatments. Additional variables were related to variation in nest failure from predation, but we found no support for the hypothesis that these causes of failure were affected by stocking rate. For savannah sparrows, daily probability of nest success (95% CI) = 0.97 (0.96-0.98); predation = 0.018 (0.008-0.028); and trampling = 0.001 (0.000-0.004).

Our results suggest grasslands managed for livestock may generally be compatible with grassland songbird conservation, at least for the species and stocking rates examined here. The most effective conservation strategies for improving nest success will involve decreasing risk of nest predation.

When such connections involve a host that provides a public good for multiple visitor species, selection for reciprocal cooperation is only likely if the host has the power to preferentially increase the fitness of those visitors that provide a better quality service. In contrast, when interactions form between multiple visitors and a host that lacks the power to partition the public good, we predict that interactions are likely to persist only as by-product mutualisms, in which symbiosis benefits both host and visitor, but in which neither partner makes costly investments. Focusing on the symbiosis between ants and litter trapping epiphytes in the canopy of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Borneo, we show that at least 71 ant species share the public good of housing within the root-mass of epiphytic bird's nest ferns (Asplenium spp.). Ferns supporting a higher biomass of ants experienced less herbivory, and experimental exclusions of ants from fronds confirmed that this is caused by the ants protecting the ferns from herbivores. These results establish that there are clear by-product benefits for both parties of housing for ants and protection for ferns. If these benefits were to drive selection for reciprocal cooperation, we would expect larger ferns to support ant colonies that were larger or colonies that produce more reproductive individuals. This was not the case. Larger ferns instead supported more ant colonies, indicating that the housing provided by the fern is a public good that is not restricted to better cooperating ant species. Mutualism via novel connections is thus unlikely to evolve between a host and multiple partners, even if there are clear by-product benefits to all parties, unless the host can direct benefits to cooperators. √Ç¬© 2011 The Authors.

Much attention to declining populations has focused on how changing climate drives phenological mismatches between animals and their food. Effects of climate on plant communities may provide an alternative, but particularly powerful, influence on animal populations because plants provide their habitats. Here, we show that abundances of deciduous trees and associated songbirds have declined with decreasing snowfall over 22 years of study in montane Arizona, USA. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that declining snowfall indirectly influences plants and associated birds by allowing greater over-winter herbivory by elk (Cervus canadensis). We excluded elk from one of two paired snowmelt drainages (10√ÑÔøΩ√¢‚Ç¨¬∞ ha per drainage), and replicated this paired experiment across three distant canyons. Over six years, we reversed multi-decade declines in plant and bird populations by experimentally inhibiting heavy winter herbivory associated with declining snowfall. Moreover, predation rates on songbird nests decreased in exclosures, despite higher abundances of nest predators, demonstrating the over-riding importance of habitat quality to avian recruitment. Thus, our results suggest that climate impacts on plant-animal interactions can have forceful ramifying effects on plants, birds, and ecological interactions. √Ç¬© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A fundamental untested assumption for the validation of this hypothesis is that males can accurately assess differences in the colour of eggs. A recent review suggests that this could be particularly problematic when egg clutches were located within a dimly lit nest cavity, due to limitations of the visual system in low light conditions. Here, we first used a photoreceptor noise-limited model of colour discrimination ability that accounts for visual performance under low light conditions to study whether a typical cavity-nesting passerine, the spotless starling Sturnus unicolor, can discriminate their eggs under the ambient illumination in their nest-holes. Secondly, we tested the validity of model predictions with behavioural data collected in two egg discrimination experiments performed in this species. Estimated egg detectability depended entirely on model assumptions about visual limitations linked to light intensity. Starlings would not be able to discriminate egg differences in their nests if the model was based on the assumption that light intensity limited detectability, whereas they could potentially perceive as different many possible pairwise clutch comparisons if the model assumption was that light intensity did not limit detectability. Results of behavioural experiments fitted the prediction of the visual model where light intensity did not limit detectability. Our results suggest that photoreceptor noise-limited colour models based on stimulation of single photoreceptors cannot, at present, be used to predict egg discrimination ability in spotless starlings under low light conditions. Future studies aiming to test egg discrimination constraints in the frame of the sexual selection hypothesis should therefore combine both modelling and behavioural experiments to determine which are the components of the models that produce the mismatch with the behavioural conditions. √Ç¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",108,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

Here we investigated whether the colour of nest materials used to build a first nest affected the subsequent nest material choices made by male zebra finches when building a second nest. Males were tested for their preference for green or brown nest material and then were provided with either their preferred or nonpreferred colour with which to build their first nest. The success of this nesting attempt was manipulated such that half of the breeding pairs had their eggs removed, while the other half were allowed to keep their eggs and fledge chicks. Males were then retested to determine which colour of nest material they now preferred. Males had strong initial preferences for one or other of the two colours of nest material. Males that built a nest with their preferred colour of nest material continued to prefer that colour after nesting, regardless of their breeding success in that nest. However, of the males that built a nest with material of their nonpreferred colour, those that raised and fledged chicks from it subsequently preferred that colour of material for their second nest, while males that suffered a failed breeding attempt did not. Thus breeding experience can influence decisions relating to nest material choice in nest construction in the zebra finch. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The feather-carrying behaviour is a sexual behaviour that is performed in response to a male display: the carrying of green plants. In this paper we explore whether foreign feathers affect male investment on chick rearing or reinforce the pair mating bonds. The experimental addition of feathers to nests caused an increase in clutch size and a reduction of nestling mortality, although it did not affect feeding rates or the removal of faecal sacs by males or females. Nest feathers did not increase the frequency with which females laid a second clutch in the same nest and with the same male. Thus, our results do not support the sexual selection hypothesis for the evolution of the carrying feathers behaviour. An alternative hypothesis that deserves to be addressed in specifically designed studies is that foreign feathers may be taken to nests as a sort of chemical warfare against nest parasites. The sexual selection and the chemical defence hypotheses are, however, not mutually exclusive and future research should evaluate whether the pre-existence of a behavioural trait arising by natural selection may drive the evolution of a signalling trait. √Ç¬© 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",112,2,"excluded","No green nest material"

We measured red (psittacofulvin), green (mixed) and blue (structural) colours of wild burrowing parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus of northeastern Patagonia, Argentina, and measured nestlings regularly to obtain data on breeding success and nestling growth. As adult feathers are moulted outside the breeding season, adult body condition could not be measured directly during feather growth, and climatic conditions were used as an indirect parameter. The colony of burrowing parrots is surrounded by Monte steppe habitat, the breeding success has been shown to depend strongly on the climatic patterns. The area experienced a drought with very poor breeding success as well as a year of above-average precipitation during the study period, serving as a natural experiment. We thus analysed the variability of colouration within the population among and within breeding seasons. We observed strong inter-annual differences in nestling and adult colouration. Nestlings grew blue feathers with lower achromatic brightness during better conditions, and when controlling for year effects, nestlings with higher mass and from more successful families also had blue feathers with lower achromatic brightness. Adult blue feathers showed the same trend, with lower achromatic brightness in the moult following breeding seasons of better conditions. In contrast, during better conditions, adults grew red feathers with higher achromatic brightness and the colour hue was also affected, and the hue of the red region of nestlings varied with the hatching order. The colour of all three regions of nestlings varied between nests, and the colour of the red region of adult males positively correlated with breeding success (clutch size, brood size). In summary, the present data suggest that environmental conditions contribute to variability in both structural and the psittacofulvin-based colours of wild burrowing parrots. √Ç¬© 2008 The Authors.",127,2,"excluded","Not experimental"

In this study, we use three different experimental approaches to explore the importance of sexual selection on blue-green egg coloration of spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) eggs. First, experimental deterioration of female body condition (by means of wing feather removal) negatively affected the intensity of blue-green egg coloration. Second, blue-green color intensity of artificial model eggs had a significant positive influence on paternal feeding effort. Finally, we found a negative relationship between the effect of experimental food supply on nestling immunocompetence and the intensity of blue-green coloration of eggs, suggesting that egg color predicts nutritional conditions that nestlings will experience during development. All these results taken together strongly support a role of sexual selection in the blue-green coloration of spotless starling eggs. √Ç¬© 2007 by The University of Chicago.

From May to July 2004, prevalence and intensity of infestation with bird blow flies Protocalliphora spp. (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were measured in nests on oil sands reclaimed wetlands and compared with those on a reference site. Nestling growth and survival also were monitored. Prevalence of infestation was surprisingly high for a small cavity nester; 100% of the 38 nests examined were infested. Nests on wetlands containing oil sands waste materials harbored on average from 60% to 72% more blow fly larvae than those on the reference site. Nestlings on reclaimed sites suffered mean parasitic burdens about twice that of those on the reference site; and for comparable parasitic load, they exhibited greater pathologic effects (e.g., decreased body mass) than control nestlings.

Guapira trees produce small fruits with a high protein content (28.4%) and low lipid content (0.3%), and the plant is primarily dispersed by birds. Mature fruits of G. opposita can fall spontaneously with the pulp intact, or be dropped by birds with bits of pulp attached. In either case, ground-dwelling ants rapidly remove the fruits to their nest (93% after 12 h). The ponerine ants Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata are the main seed vectors among the ants, and together account for 56% (20 of 36) of the ant-fruit interactions recorded on the forest floor. Individual workers of O. chelifer and P. striata transport single fruits to their nests. Bits of pulp are fed to larvae and worker nestmates, and intact seeds are discarded outside the nest. Germination success in Guapira is higher for cleaned seeds (pulp removed) than for seeds coated by pulp. Guapira seedlings and juveniles are more frequent close to Odontomachus nests than at sites without such nests. Soil samples from Odontomachus nests had greater penetrability, and higher concentrations of P, K, and Ca than random soil samples. Field experiments suggest that the association between G. opposita seedlings and O. chelifer nests can potentially render the plant some protection against herbivores. Results indicate that fruit displacement by ponerine ants play an important role in the biology of G. opposita seeds and seedlings in the sandy forest, and illustrate the complex nature of the dispersal ecology of tropical tree species. √Ç¬© Springer-Verlag 2004.",151,2,"excluded","Not birds"

Three new IVC filters have recently been approved for use in the United States. An in vitro study was performed to compare the risk of engaging and entrapping guide wires in eight of the IVC filters currently available in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium Greenfield, over-the-wire stainless-steel Greenfield, Simon nitinol, Bird's Nest, Vena Tech LGM, Vena Tech LP, TrapEase, and G√É¬ºnther Tulip IVC filters were deployed separately in an in vitro IVC flow model. Four different wires (15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped, and straight) were passed 100 times each through the filters (50 from a jugular approach and 50 from a femoral approach). The frequency and specific patterns of engagement of the wires by the filters were recorded. Engagement was defined as a filter/wire interaction that caused either the filter or the wire to be deformed. The second part of the experiment measured the force (in pounds) that was required to release wires that became engaged in the filters with use of an electromechanical test stand with a specially designed low-capacity load cell of 20 pounds. Entrapment was defined as inability to separate an engaged wire from the filter without damage to either the wire or filter. RESULTS: Guide wire engagement occurred in all filters tested with the 15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped wires. The straight wire did not engage any of the filters. The wires engaged the TrapEase filter with the greatest frequency overall (72.8%; 291 of 400). The 15-mm J wire engaged the filters more often than the other wires (98.5%; 788 of 800), but never became entrapped in a filter. The Vena Tech LP and G√É¬ºnther Tulip filters did not entrap any of the wires. The TrapEase filter, the stainless-steel Greenfield filter, and the Vena Tech LGM filter entrapped the 3-mm and 1.5-mm J wires. The force required to disengage the wires from these filters exceeded 4 pounds and resulted in structural damage to the wire and/or filter. CONCLUSIONS: Among the IVC filters recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the TrapEase filter entrapped 3-mm and 1.5-mm J-tipped guide wires, whereas the Vena Tech LP and G√É¬ºnther Tulip filters did not.

Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from 210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the 1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends on Brooding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30 year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina; Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seirus aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food availability and events in the migratory and winter periods. Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term population trends.

The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands. √Ç¬© 2022 The Authors.

Median survival time remains at 16-20 months despite multimodal treatment with surgical resection, radiation, temozolomide and tumor-treating fields therapy. After genotoxic stress glioma cells initiate cytoprotective autophagy, which contributes to treatment resistance, limiting the efficacy of these therapies and providing an avenue for glioma recurrence. Antagonism of autophagy steps has recently gained attention as it may enhance the efficacy of classical chemotherapies and newer immune-stimulating therapies. The modulation of autophagy in the clinic is limited by the low potency of common autophagy inhibitors and the inability of newer ones to cross the blood-brain barrier. Herein, we leverage lucanthone, an anti-schistosomal agent which crosses the blood-brain barrier and was recently reported to act as an autophagy inhibitor in breast cancer cells. Our studies show that lucanthone was toxic to glioma cells by inhibiting autophagy. It enhanced anti-glioma temozolomide (TMZ) efficacy at sub-cytotoxic concentrations, and suppressed the growth of stem-like glioma cells and temozolomide-resistant glioma stem cells. In vivo lucanthone slowed tumor growth: reduced numbers of Olig2+ glioma cells, normalized tumor vasculature, and reduced tumor hypoxia. We propose that lucanthone may serve to perturb a mechanism of temozolomide resistance and allow for successful treatment of TMZ-resistant glioblastoma.

Here I analyze the egg appearance of an East African weaverbird species that has variable eggs and is a host of brood parasitism by an egg-mimicking cuckoo, in order to (1) compare population variation to variation within a clutch as a measure of the distinctiveness of eggs; (2) assess modularity versus correlation among egg appearance traits as an indication of the complexity of egg signatures; and (3) address whether the eggs are discretely polymorphic or continuously variable in appearance. I also compare three methods of assessing egg coloration: reduction of spectral data to orthogonal components, targeted spectral shape variables, and avian visual modeling. Then I report the results of egg replacement experiments that assess the relationship between egg rejection behavior and the difference in appearance between own and foreign eggs. R√É¬ºppell√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s weaver (Ploceus galbula) eggs are variable in appearance between individuals and consistent within a clutch, but vary widely in the distinctiveness of particular traits. Most aspects of color and spotting are decoupled from each other, including coloration likely to derive from different pigments. Egg ground color is bimodal, with a broad continuous class of off-white/UV eggs and another broad class of blue-green eggs. Variation in all other traits is unimodal and usually normal in distribution. Females reject foreign eggs on the basis of the difference in brightness of the ground color and spotting of foreign eggs relative to their own, and the difference in degree to which spots are aggregated at the broad end of the egg. This aggregation is among the most distinctive features of their eggs, but the brightness of the ground color and spotting brightness are not; the birds√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ use of brightness rather than the more distinctive chromatic variation to recognize eggs might reflect the salience of achromatic contrast in a dim enclosed nest. √Ç¬© Copyright √Ç¬© 2021 Lahti.",47,1,"excluded","duplicate"

Living fences in abandoned croplands, however, add a structural component to the landscape which can help to mitigate the effects of disturbance. We used artificial nests to assess whether a living fence at the edge of a fragment of tropical dry forest, immersed in an agricultural landscape, can assuage the edge effect by decreasing predation rates. We identified the predators that attacked nests at several distances from the living fence and related the frequency of predator attacks with plant height, leaf height diversity, and tree and herb coverage. Vegetation structure of the living fence was vertically more complex than that found inside the fragment. 52% of nests were predated and we did not find a significant relationship between predation rates and the proximity of nests to the living fence, suggesting a null edge effect on predation. Birds were the most frequent predators, followed by rodents and carnivorous mammals, with the composition of predators varying among transects. The composition of predators and vegetation structure of the living fence were the factors that explained the null edge effect on nests predation. Our results indicate that the presence of a living fence at the edge of a fragment in agroforestry systems could mitigate the edge effects on nest predation. √Ç¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",195,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

In rats interneuronal circuits at two levels of the spinal cord (i.e., L6-S1 and L3-L4) play an important role in this coordination. In the present experiments retrograde trans-synaptic transport of pseudorabies virus (PRV) encoding fluorescent markers (GFP and RFP) was used to trace these circuits. To examine the relative localization of EUS-related and BL-related interneuronal populations we injected PRV-GFP into the EUS and PRV-RFP into the BL wall. The PRV infected populations of spinal interneurons were localized primarily in the dorsal commissure (DCM) of L6/S1 and in a hypothesized lumbar spinal coordinating center (LSCC) in L3/L4 above and lateral to central canal (CC). At both sites colocalization of markers occurred in a substantial number of labeled interneurons indicating concomitant involvement of these double-labelled neurons in the EUS- and BL-circuits and suggesting their role in EUS-BL coordination. Intense GFP or RFP fluorescent was detected in a subpopulation of cells at both sites suggesting that they were infected earlier and therefore likely to represent first order, primary interneurons that directly synapse with output neurons. Larger numbers of weakly fluorescent neurons that likely represent second order interneurons were also identified. Within the population of EUS-related first order interneurons only 3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú8 % exhibited positive immunoreaction for an early transcription factor Pax2 specific to GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory neurons suggesting that the majority of interneurons in DCM and LSCC projecting directly to the EUS motoneurons are excitatory. √Ç¬© 2020 The Author(s)",199,1,"excluded","Out of field"

We used a large-scale study that experimentally manipulated herbicide application intensity within regenerating forests to test how herbicide-mediated changes in temperature influenced three components of reproductive output in the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon): nest survival, the number of offspring produced, and nestling body condition. We found no evidence for a consistent herbicide treatment effect on any reproductive measure, although our power to detect effects was modest. Relative to unsprayed controls, nest survival was lowest in the light herbicide treatment, and this measure increased on sites that were subjected to greater herbicide application (i.e., at moderate and intensive herbicide treatments), against our predictions. We also detected no evidence of a temperature effect singly or in combination with herbicide application on wren reproductive output. Although herbicide intensity was more influential on reproductive output than was temperature, we found that neither exerted strong effects in regenerating conifer forests. Given the dearth of studies that combine evaluations of temperature and land management impacts on songbird reproductive output, we suggest researchers continue to expand our understanding of the relative influence of both drivers simultaneously to better formulate conservation strategies in light of expected changes in climate and a heightened global demand for wood products. √Ç¬© 2020 by the author(s).",201,1,"excluded","duplicate"

To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúprey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúprey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development. √Ç¬© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America",55,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

NSCs and miR-26a-NSCs were stereoscopically injected into the cerebral cortex of the modeled rats, respectively. The survival and migration of NSCs infected with recombinant lentivirus expressing green fluorescence in vivo was observed under a light microscope. The neurobehavioral functions, morphology, and ultrastructure of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, apoptosis of brain cells, expression of apoptosis-related protein caspase-3 and Bax, together with the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were determined. Expression of miR-26a in NSCs infected with plVTHM-miR-26a increased significantly. After NSCs transplantation, the neurobehavioral status of CP rats was improved, the degree of brain pathological injury was alleviated, the apoptotic index of cells in cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the expression of the apoptotic protein (caspase-3 and Bax) were decreased, the expression of GFAP were significantly decreased. After miR-26a-NSCs transplantation, these aforementioned results further improved or decreased.

Although numerous exclosure experiments have demonstrated negative impacts of deer on songbirds at small spatial scales, the effects of deer on avian communities at large spatial and temporal scales remains poorly understood. We integrated data from the Breeding Bird Survey with historic information on deer abundance in a multi-species hierarchical model to assess spatio-temporal relationships between deer and bird abundances across the state of Pennsylvania between 1981 and 2015. Our results provide evidence of strong links between deer and both avian functional groups and individual species, depending upon the extent each relied upon particular forest strata. Specifically, species that forage or nest near the ground were more negatively affected by deer than canopy-associated species. Likewise, mature-forest species were more sensitive to deer than successional-forest species or habitat generalists. With only a few exceptions, species-level responses to deer were consistent with group-level effects. Given the diverse suite of spatio-temporal stressors impacting migratory songbirds throughout their annual cycle, it was not surprising that long-term population trends of focal species were not significantly associated with deer abundance. Our findings, however, provide evidence that deer play an important role in songbird community structure, as mediated by the reliance of individual species upon particular forest strata and, as such, should be considered within the context of forest bird conservation. √Ç¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",205,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

We investigated the relationships between exposure to NOE and older adults' self-rated health in Shanghai, China and examined whether these relationships varied by sex, age, education and hukou status. Method: This cross-sectional study used micro-data sample of the 2010 Shanghai population census, including 7962 older adults nested within 3345 neighbourhoods. Self-rated health was the outcome variable. Four NOE exposure indicators were calculated for each neighbourhood: the amount of surrounding greenness/blueness and proximity to large green/blue spaces. Multilevel logistic regression was employed to explore the association between natural outdoor environment exposure and self-rated health, adjusting for individual-level and neighbourhood-level covariates. Stratified analyses were used to examine variations by sex, age, education and hukou status. Results: Older adults living in neighbourhoods with higher surrounding greenness and higher proximity to both green spaces and blue spaces were more likely to report good health. Residential surrounding blueness was not significantly related to self-rated health.

Recently, we have reported miR-302/367-mediated in vivo conversion of astrocytes into neuroblasts and neurons. In the current study, we used miR-302/367 and valproate (VPA) to show the possibility of conversion of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and myelinating cells in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced model of demyelination. Evaluation of behavioural impairment following CPZ and consequent to the treatments showed functional recovery from impairments. Enhanced remyelination was detected by luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining against two mature myelin markers, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein. Tracing of transduced cells with green fluorescent protein showed their contribution toward generation of new myelinating cells. These findings have suggested that in vivo specific targeting of astrocytes for forced expression of the miR-302/367 cluster and VPA administration may increase the brain's potential for repairing myelin insults by the generation of oligodendroglia from astrocytes.

Scientists continue to finesse genetic manipulation in mice. Yet mice do not exhibit every behavior of interest. For example, Mus musculus do not readily imitate sounds, a trait known as vocal learning and a feature of speech. In contrast, thousands of bird species exhibit this ability. The circuits and underlying molecular mechanisms appear similar between disparate avian orders and are shared with humans. An advantage of studying vocal learning birds is that the neurons dedicated to this trait are nested within the surrounding brain regions, providing anatomical targets for relating brain and behavior. In songbirds, these nuclei are known as the song control system. Molecular function can be interrogated in non-traditional model organisms by exploiting the ability of viruses to insert genetic material into neurons to drive expression of experimenter-defined genes. To date, the use of viruses in the song control system is limited. Here, we review prior successes and test additional viruses for their capacity to transduce basal ganglia song control neurons. These findings provide a roadmap for troubleshooting the use of viruses in animal champions of fascinating behaviors√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùnowhere better featured than at the 12th International Congress! √Ç¬© 2017, The Author(s).",221,1,"excluded","Not empirical"

Competition for breeding resources or mates is predicted to affect the expression of signals in both males and females; however, the literature has been typically focused on male behaviors. The spotless starling is an interesting example where both sexes decorate the nest to signal their condition and social status: males add green plants at the beginning of the breeding period, and females place foreign feathers during the incubation period. In this study, we investigate nest decoration by males and females in relation to the intensity of conspecific competition during the breeding period. We distributed nest boxes at either a high (HD) or a low density (LD) and recorded the amount of green plant material added before laying, the number of feathers at hatching, and the breeding productivity under these different density treatments. The amount of green plant material and the number of feathers at hatching were higher in HD than in LD nests. Furthermore, nest boxes at higher density had lower breeding productivity. Our results suggest that manipulating the density of nest boxes increased competition for breeding resources. The aggregation of males competing for territories and mates may stimulate them to add greater amounts of plants, and competition over those males or other resources for reproduction may induce females to add feathers. This study shows that social environment has the potential to influence the expression of signaling behaviors in both males and females. √Ç¬© The Author 2017.",222,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Ants are prominent bioindicators used in assessing ecological responses to disturbance. However, behavioral data have been poorly incorporated as an index. The foraging performance of red harvester ants was quantified in order to evaluate the success of a restoration ecology experiment in the tropical dry forest of Sierra de Huautla, Morelos, in central Mexico. Foraging performance by granivorous, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, ants was diminished after 6 and 8 years of cattle grazing and wood harvest were excluded as part of a restoration experiment in a highly degraded biome. Despite investing more time in foraging, ant colonies in exclusion plots showed lower foraging success and acquired less seed biomass than colonies in control plots. In line with the predictions of optimal foraging theory, in restored plots where ant foraging performance was poor, ants harvested a higher diversity of seeds. Reduced foraging success and increased harvest of non-preferred foods in exclusion plots were likely due to the growth of herbaceous vegetation, which impedes travel by foragers. Moreover, by 8 years of exclusion, 37% of nests in exclusion plots had disappeared compared to 0% of nests in control plots. Ants' foraging success and behavior were sensitive to changes in habitat quality due to the plant successional process triggered by a restoration intervention.

However, in most studies the exact amount of light at night individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects, e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore, effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of light at night. √Ç¬© 2016 de Jong et al.

We also hypothesized that adult neural progenitor cells form functional cellular networks relevant for their development. We isolated neuronal progenitor cells from the subventricular zone of 5-week-old mice to investigate the role of gap junctions, calcium homeostasis, and cellular networks in cell differentiation and survival. Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR showed that the cells expressed the gap junction components connexin 26, 36, 43, and 45, and that expression of connexin 43 increased in early (8 days) differentiated cells. Transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry also indicated that gap junctions were present. Scrape-loading experiments showed dye transfer between cells that could be prevented by gapjunction blockers; thus, functional intercellular gap junctions had been established. However, dye transfer was four times stronger in differentiated cultures, correlating with the increased connexin 43 expression. During timelapse calcium imaging, both differentiated and undifferentiated cultures showed spontaneous calcium activity that was reduced by gap junction blockers. Crosscorrelation analysis of the calcium recordings showed that the cells were interconnected through gap junctions and that the early-differentiated cells were organized in smallworld networks. Gap junction blockers did not affect proliferation and differentiation, but resulted in twice as many apoptotic cells. mRNAi knockdown of connexin 43 also doubled the number of apoptotic cells. We conclude that adult neural progenitor cells form networks in vitro that are strengthened during early differentiation by increased expression of connexin 43. The networks are functional and improve cell survival. Copyright √Ç¬© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",239,1,"excluded","Out of field"

Based on the evidence for the neurogenic role of serotonin (5-HT) in the postnatal gut and the observation of enteric neuronal hyperplasia in inflammatory bowel disease, we hypothesized that colitis induces a neurogenic response through 5-HT 4 receptor signaling. Methods: We examined the effects of 5-HT 4 agonism on colonic neurogenesis and gliogenesis in vitro and in vivo in adult mice using dextran sodium sulfate to experimentally induce colitis. Results: In vitro, 5-HT 4 agonism led to increased neuronal proliferation and density. Induction of experimental colitis in vivo similarly resulted in increased numbers of myenteric neurons, and this was inhibited by 5-HT 4 antagonism. Interestingly, both in vitro and in vivo, 5-HT 4 signaling increased glial cell proliferation but did not increase glial cell numbers, leading us to hypothesize that glia may give rise to neurons. After induction of colitis in normal, Nestin-GFP and Sox2-GFP transgenic mice, it was revealed that multiple glial markers (Sox2, Nestin, and CD49b) became strongly expressed by enteric neurons. Immunoselected enteric glia were found to give rise to neurons in culture, and this was inhibited in the presence of 5-HT 4 blockade. Finally, isolated glia gave rise to a neuronal network upon transplantation into aganglionic embryonic avian hindgut. Conclusions: These results show that colitis promotes enteric neurogenesis in the adult colon through a serotonin-dependent mechanism that drives glial cells to transdifferentiate into neurons.

Here we provide the first experimental study that jointly explores how urban biodiversity can be enhanced and how these changes may influence some aspects of people-biodiversity interactions. We significantly increased the diversity of flowers, birds and pollinators in small public gardens (Paris, France) by providing additional resources (i.e., planting flower-meadows and placing nesting-boxes). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in situ with 1116 regular garden users before and after the manipulation. Close-ended questionnaires were completed exploring the respondents' biodiversity perception and their sensitivity to the changes in biodiversity. Our results highlight a people-biodiversity paradox between people's perceptions and biodiversity awareness. Respondents expressed a strong preference for a rich diversity of species (excluding insects) and related this diversity to their well-being in the gardens. However, they did not notice the diversity of species. Respondents underestimated species richness and only noticed the changes in native flower richness in those gardens where advertisement and public involvement were organized. More experimental interdisciplinary studies are needed to further explore the people-biodiversity interactions.

Some myrmecophytic plants, such as the epiphytic orchid Caularthron bilamellatum, actively form hollow structures that provide nesting space for ants (myrmecodomatia), despite a substantial loss of water-storage tissue. This study aimed at assessing the ability of the orchid to take up nitrogen from ant-inhabited domatia as possible trade-off for the sacrifice of potential water storage capacity.MethodsNitrogen uptake capabilities and uptake kinetics of 15N-labelled compounds (NH 4+, urea and l-glutamine) were studied in field-grown Caularthron bilamellatum plants in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Plants were either labelled directly, by injecting substrates into the hollow pseudobulbs or indirectly, by labelling of the associated ants in situ.Key ResultsCaularthron bilamellatum plants were able to take up all tested inorganic and organic nitrogen forms through the inner surface of the pseudobulbs. Uptake of NH4+ and glutamine followed MichaelisMenten kinetics, but urea uptake was not saturable up to 2 mm. 15N-labelled compounds were rapidly translocated and incorporated into vegetative and reproductive structures. By labelling ants with 15N in situ, we were able to prove that ants transfer N to the plants under field conditions.ConclusionsBased on 15N labelling experiments we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that a myrmecophytic orchid is capable of actively acquiring different forms of nitrogen from its domatia and that nutrient flux from ants to plants does indeed occur under natural conditions. This suggests that beyond anti-herbivore protection host plants benefit from ants by taking up nitrogen derived from ant debris. √Ç¬© 2012 The Author.",266,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Our results showed that CNP::EGFP mice were significantly more susceptible to CPZ-induced demyelination, as evaluated by MBP immunostaining, oligodendroglial progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment and astroglial, microglial and nestin response. This enhanced vulnerability was a consequence of their hypomyelination. CNP::EGFP control mice also displayed a significant decrease in corpus callosum (CC) thickness and MBP immunoreactivity. Morphometric analysis further showed a significant decrease in the frequency of myelinated axons, myelin turns (lamellae) and g-ratio carried out in the optic nerve (ON) and CC of CNP::EGFP, as compared to WT mice. Moreover, our results showed a decrease in the number of axons of small caliber, concomitantly with an increase in the number of axons of bigger size with more and enlarged mitochondria, which suggests a high energy demand. These findings and those displaying that MBP+ cells and NF200 staining in the CNP::EGFP cortex were more sparsely distributed provide evidence of axonal loss, which was supported by a decreased number of NeuN+ cells in the CA3 fields of the hippocampus. Transgenic mice also showed an increase in microglial and astroglial activation, accompanied by enhanced lipid peroxidation and recruitment of morphologically altered OPC. Finally, CNPase protein levels proved to be lower than MBP in the CC, which might indicate an altered pattern in myelin proteins with a CNPase deficiency. Behavioral analysis of adult CNP::EGFP transgenic mice supported our results, as it revealed a decrease in locomotion, exploratory activity and motor impairment, as compared to their WT littermates. Our data highlight the relevance of confronting results obtained in adult CNP::EGFP mice with those observed in WT mice. According to our findings, CNP::EGFP hypomyelination might be triggered by the cellular stress induced by the high level of EGFP expression in mature OLG. Adult CNP::EGFP mice could be considered a useful tool to evaluate future therapies for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), since these animals present chronic demyelination with axonal degeneration, a characteristic of such pathologies. √Ç¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc..",271,1,"excluded","Out of field"

Nestin is also highly expressed in the glomerular podocyte, a type of terminally differentiated epithelial cell. Little is known about the significance of nestin in podocytes. Methods: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was injected into the rats to produce a PAN nephrosis model. Transmission electronic microscopy and terminal dUTP nick end-labeling assay were used to examine the podocyte foot process (FP) effacement and apoptosis, respectively. A mouse podocyte cell line was cultured and incubated with PAN. Immunoblot was used to examine the level of nestin expression both in vivo and in vitro. Enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged plasmids containing nestin shRNA were transfected into the cultured podocytes to silence nestin expression. F-actin arrangement within cultured podocytes was investigated by immunofluorescence, while the apoptosis rate was examined by both Hoechst stain and flow cytometry. Results: In the PAN-induced rat nephrosis model, podocyte nestin expression was increased in the absence of apparent podocyte apoptosis, even though the FP was significantly effaced. In the cultured mouse podocytes, PAN upregulated nestin expression in a time-dependent manner within 24 h of treatment. Notably, no significant apoptosis occurred, however knocking down nestin expression resulted in a remarkable derangement of actin cytoskeleton and an increase in apoptosis in the cultured podocytes 24 h after being incubated with PAN. Conclusions: Upregulation of nestin expression during PAN nephrosis could protect podocytes from apoptosis and that this process is mediated by maintaining the regular arrangement of actin cytoskeleton.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effi ciency of the methods used to manage and control the feral pigeon population in Ljubljana. The effectiveness of progesterone, ultrasound deterrent and artifi cial dovecots for egg collection was tested in order to evaluate different approaches to feral pigeon population management in Ljubljana. The most effective method of pigeon control was the use of contraceptives, since the number of pigeons in selected locations of the wider centre of Ljubljana decreased by 49.1% (P>0.05) in the period from 1999 to 2004. The method of ultrasound as a pigeon deterrent remains questionable, since no distinctive deterrent effects were established, even though pigeons in our experiment showed significant (P<0.001) signs of agitation when ultrasound was present in the tested area of the covered passage entrance to the urban land fill in Ljubljana. The method of pigeon nesting in 8 green plot and 2 house attic artificial dovecots, which we are investigating at present, seems to have great potential regarding the egg collecting and consequently the reduction of the number of feral pigeons, improving nesting hygiene and hobby feeding control. After a 10-month period, since the green plot dovecots were built, pigeons have already started to nest in 62% of the available nesting space, however eggs will not be collected until the dovecots are populated completely. The house attic dovecotes were only built recently, so they were still un-populated at the end of this study.

Currently, neither inorganic nor organic polymers are ideal scaffold materials for spinal cord tissue engineering. The polypeptide with active structure in humor or culture solution could form porous scaffold with coincident visco-elasticity with spinal cord, which may become excellent scaffold material for spinal cord tissue engineering. OBJECTIVE: Mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) were implanted in the surface of self-assembled hydrogel from IKVAV-containing peptide amphiphile (IKVAV-PA) to observe its influence on cell differentiation. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: Contrast observation at cellular level. The experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from October to November 2006. MATERIALS: Polypeptide sequence C 16H31O-A3G4D2IKVAV (Mw = 1 438.31, purity=96.06%) was self-made. Neonatal mice were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. METHODS: NSCs harvested from the cerebral cortex of neonatal mice were dissociated mechanically and cultivated in serum-free media; three-dimensional self-assembly hydrogel from 1wt% amphiphilic peptide was formed with addition of DMEM/F12. NSCs at density of 1√É‚Äî108/L were respectively incubated in the surface of hydrogel (experimental group) and the coverslips covered with polylysine (control group) for two weeks, and were examined immunocytochemically. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Isolated cells were immunohistochemically examined for nestin, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); hydrogel nanofiber morphology was observed. Expression of nestin, NSE and GFAP of the hydrogel surface was detected. RESULTS: The nestin-positive cells obtained were able to be differentiated into NSE-positive neurons and GFAP-positive glial cells; transmission electron microscope showed that the hydrogel was composed of nanofiber network, their diameter ranging from 3 to 6 nm and the length from 100 nm to 1.5 √é¬ºm; The cells had processes after seven days of incubation, and neurofilament-positive neuron-like cells labeled with red fluorescence and GFAP-positive glial-like cells with green fluorescence were found in experimental group. However, only undifferentiated nestin-positive neurospheres labeled with green fluorescence were found in control group. CONCLUSION: The three-dimensional self-assembled hydrogel from IKVAV-PA has good compatibility with NSCs, and capacity to induce NSCs to differentiate into neurons and glial cells.",287,1,"excluded","Out of field"

The overall prevalence of Leucocytozoon spp. infection was 4 after the standard microscopic examination and 17 using the PCR diagnostics.

Blue egg coloration has been suggested as a sexually selected signal of female quality to males, and some recent studies are in accordance with this hypothesis. Blue eggshell coloration results from the deposition of biliverdin pigment by laying females, which is a potent antioxidant. Thus, egg pigmentation should be costly in terms of antioxidants, an assumption of the signaling hypothesis that has not been tested yet. We induced increased reproductive effort in a set of female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca through nest removal and measured egg pigmentation and plasma antioxidant levels in relation with a control group. Experimental females showed a negative association between egg color and plasma antioxidant levels, while there was no relationship for control birds. This supports that egg pigmentation is costly in terms of general antioxidant defenses and suggests a tradeoff between the allocations to both traits. Furthermore, experimental females with more colorful eggs raised more fledglings, especially when breeding early. Controls did not show a relationship between egg color and reproductive success. Females laying more colorful eggs could have shifted their allocation decisions towards current reproduction, at the expense of their own antioxidant defenses. Our results highlight that blue egg coloration is a life-history trait, subject to tradeoffs with other attributes, and seems to be especially informative under harsh breeding conditions. √Ç¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",293,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

By modulating the allograft treatment modality we were able to study migratory, denervated, rejecting, and reinnervated phenotypes in transgenic mice whose SCs expressed GFP under regulatory elements of either the S100b (S100-GFP) or nestin (Nestin-GFP) promoters. Well-differentiated SCs strongly expressed S100-GFP, while Nestin-GFP expression was stimulated by denervation, and in some cases, axons were constitutively labeled with CFP to enable in vivo imaging. Serial imaging of these mice demonstrated that untreated allografts were rejected within 20√Ç¬†days. Cold preserved (CP) allografts required an initial phase of SC migration that preceded axonal regeneration thus delaying myelination and maturation of the SC phenotype. Mice immunosuppressed with FK506 demonstrated mild subacute rejection, but the most robust regeneration of myelinated and unmyelinated axons and motor endplate reinnervation. While characterized by fewer regenerating axons, mice treated with the co-stimulatory blockade (CSB) agents anti-CD40L mAb and CTLAIg-4 demonstrated virtually no graft rejection during the 28√Ç¬†day experiment, and had significant increases in myelination, connexin-32 expression, and Akt phosphorylation compared with any other group.

The consequences and underlying reasons for this behaviour have not been evaluated, and it is unclear whether nests in mistletoes confer advantages compared with other available substrates. Nest predation is often cited as the most important factor regulating many bird populations and is thought to influence all aspects of nest-site selection. To evaluate whether nest predation may play a role in the widespread use of mistletoe as a nest-site, we conducted an artificial nest predation experiment in a eucalypt woodland in southern New South Wales, Australia. Artificial nests were modelled on noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus: Meliphagidae) nests, baited with a single quail egg and checked after four days. We used logistic regression to model the rate of depredation between plant substrates, and demonstrate that, in this experiment, mistletoe nests experienced a lower proportion of predation than eucalypt nests (51.5% versus 63.8% respectively). This finding suggests that predation may influence the widespread use of mistletoe as a nest-site in a range of habitats and regions. In addition to clarifying priorities for further work on mistletoe nesting, this finding has implications for studies of nest-site selection generally, with researchers encouraged to supplement between-substrate comparisons with direct measurements of within-substrate variation. √Ç¬© CSIRO 2008.",296,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Nitrogen, which is required in the greatest quantity of all mineral nutrients absorbed by plant roots, is an essential component of protein. While the beneficial effects of fertilizer N application on crop production are well documented, concern on the long-term role of fertilizer N in maintaining soil productivity, crop quality (including elemental composition and balance, protein, oil, fatty acids), and environmental safety is being expressed more frequently in recent years. The long-term strategy of N use in agriculture likely will involve increased reliance on fertilizer N, biological N fixation (BNF) by leguminous crops, and wastes (including farm, urban, and industrial wastes) and their efficient management. Recovery of applied N by crops in field experiments has been found commonly ranging from 25 to 34% for rice (Oryza sativa L.) and 40 to 60% for other crops, with the global average value of about 50% (Mosier, 2002). Unutilized N may remain in the soil in various forms and/or get lost through several processes, including NH3 volatilization, denitrification, and nitrate leaching, which have been discussed in detail in several reviews (Aulakh et al., 1992; Carpenter et al., 1998; Goulding, 2004; Guillard et al., 1995; Malhi et al., 1991, 2002a; Singh et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995). For enhancing applied nitrogen use efficiency by crops (NUE), several management techniques have been developed for different soils, crops, seasons, and regions. Examples of these include (a) integrated and judicious use of chemical fertilizers and organic manures, (b) synchronizing N supply with crop need by split applications during crop growth, (c) reducing loss of applied N with nest or band placement or large urea granules in soil, and (d) use of slow-release fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors (Aulakh, 1994; Keeney, 1982; Malhi and Nyborg, 1985, 1988; Nyborg and Malhi, 1992). The amounts of different nutrients absorbed by a crop from soil may vary 10,000-fold, from 200 kg of N ha-1 to less than 20 g of Mo ha-1, and yet rarely do these nutrients work in isolation. As agriculture becomes more intensive, the extent and severity of nutrient deficiencies and the practical significance of nutrient interactions increase. Interactions among nutrients occur when the supply of one nutrient affects the absorption, distribution, or function of another nutrient (Robson and Pitman, 1983). In crop production, nutrient interactions assume added significance by affecting crop productivity and returns from investments made by farmers in fertilizers. Interaction between two or more nutrients can be positive (synergistic), negative (antagonistic), or even absent (reflected as additive effect). When the effect of one factor (e.g., nutrient) is influenced by the effect of another factor, the two factors are said to interact. When the crop yield reaches an early plateau, it may be due to the limiting supplies of another nutrient illustrating the operation of Liebig's """"law of the minimum"""" (Cooke and Gething, 1978). When that nutrient is supplied, yield will continue to increase until another factor becomes limiting. When solar radiation, temperature, and soil water availability are nonlimiting, plant nutrient requirements will be higher; for which Wallace (1990) proposed the """"law of the maximum"""" in contrast to the """"law of minimum."""" The law of maximum states that when the need is fully satisfied for every factor involved in the process, the rate of the process can be at its maximum potential, which is greater than the sum of its parts because of a sequentially additive interaction (Wallace, 1990). Production of field crops has already entered into the stage of multiple nutrient deficiencies management. For instance, in south Asia, a farmer in the rice-wheat belt needs to manage four to six nutrients to safeguard and sustain an annual harvest of 10 tons grain ha-1, whereas a tea planter in India targeting for a yield of over 4.5 tons tea ha-1 must worry about seven to eight nutrients. Thus, when the combined effect of two factors is more than their additive effects, the interaction is positive. When their combined effect is less than their additive effects, the interaction is negative. Therefore, just because factor A + factor B plot produces a higher yield than either A-treated or B-treated plot does not mean that there is a positive A √É‚Äî B interaction. A brief review on the interaction effects of N with P, K, S, and Cu has been given previously (Aulakh and Malhi, 2004). As N function in plant growth and nutrition is closely connected to C, the C/N ratio controls N availability and potentially affects interactions through the processes of organic residue decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) formation in soil, biomass production (photosynthesis minus respiration) in plant, and energy flow in and through all levels of the ecosystem (Wilkinson et al., 2000). An understanding of the nature of different interactions, factors affecting them, and the ways and means of managing these for useful purposes is vital for developing, advocating, and practicing a balanced and efficient crop nutrient management strategy. Identification and exploitation of positive interactions hold the key for increasing returns in terms of crop yield, produce quality, and nutrient use efficiency from applied N. Knowledge of the negative interactions is equally valuable because the test of """"precision crop nutrition"""" lies in the ability to minimize the losses from antagonistic effects. Nutrient interactions have a role to play in determining the course and outcome of two major issues of interest in fertilizer management, namely balanced fertilizer input and efficient fertilizer use. This article reviews and analyzes the available information to (a) examine the impact of interactions of applied N with other nutrients, nutrient cycles, and water on NUE, (b) consider the influence of NUE on the utilization of other nutrients and water, and on C sequestration and storage in soil, (c) compute relative consumption of major fertilizer nutrients (N, P, and K) for assessing their over, under, or balanced use in different regions, and (d) pinpoint the gaps in knowledge for future research needs to optimize the use of N and other nutrients for sustainable crop production and reducing environmental risks. The fertilizer use efficiency indicators considered in this chapter are (i) agronomic efficiency calculated as production of grain over control per unit of applied fertilizer nutrient (Novoa and Loomis, 1981), (ii) improvement in nutrient uptake as measured by apparent recovery efficiency, namely uptake of fertilizer nutrient by plant over control per unit of applied fertilizer nutrient (Dilz, 1988), and (iii) improvement in crop quality parameters such as protein, oil, and fatty acid content. Similarly, water use efficiency (WUE) computed as (i) crop yield m-2 field area m-1 water used and (ii) crop yield m-2 field area m-1 water transpiration or evapotranspiration is considered here. As the impacts can be on a local, regional, or global scale, examples have been cited for different levels. Emphasis is placed on the cereal crops that occupy more than 50% of the harvested area of crop land and contribute more than 75% to annual world food production, but other field crops, such as oilseeds and pulses, vegetables, horticultural crops, and perennials are also discussed. Keeping the practical utility of research in view, a preference has been accorded to results obtained from field experiments over greenhouse and pot culture studies. √Ç¬© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

These high-frequency, low-intensity fires likely resulted in little mortality of mature oaks, low but continuous tree recruitment, an open understory, and a fine-grained mosaic of vegetation patches. Following settlement by Europeans in the mid-1800s, ranchers burned to reduce shrub cover and to increase grassland area and forage production; surface fires were common with average fire-return intervals of 8-15 yr. Fire suppression, begun in the 1940s to 1950s, led to increases in surface and crown fuels, invasion of woody vegetation in the understory, and increased tree density. In the absence of demonstrated fire effects on oak woodland birds, we used changes in vegetation structure expected to result from fire and fire suppression to predict the response of oak woodland birds to fire and fire suppression based on nesting habitat of 17 common oak woodland species breeding at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, California. Our results suggest that populations of Western Kingbirds (Tyrannus verticalis), Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and Violet-green Swallows (Tachycineta thalassina), would increase in abundance following fire, because they consistently nested in habitat similar to that expected to result from frequent, low-intensity fire. The species predicted to respond negatively to changes resulting from fire differed among the variables examined. If fire produces a mosaic of habitat patches rather than a homogeneous landscape, we expect that the differing habitat needs of most species will be provided for. As with fire, the most obvious change resulting from excluding livestock was an increase in shrub cover. The question naturally arises to what extent livestock grazing creates habitat similar to that created by historical fire, but this question remains unstudied. More fire-history research is needed to understand past fire regimes of oak woodlands and the effects of fire, including prescribed fire, on the vegetation and the bird community. The effects of grazing and the extent to which grazing mimics fire clearly require more study. We encourage others to test our hypotheses regarding responses of birds to variables expected to be altered by fire: shrub cover, tree density, and numbers of snags, saplings, and logs. Finally, we need to test our working hypothesis that a mosaic of habitat patches will provide the habitat conditions needed to sustain the high avian diversity characteristic of oak woodlands.",311,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

We examined the inner ear of mice at the following postnatal days (P): P0, P4, P5, P15 and P60. Hair cells stereocilia were identified with the use of the histochemical marker phalloidin. Whole endorgans or cryosections were analyzed under epi-fluorescent or confocal microscopy. From P0 to P5, GFP expressing cells were found in the vestibular sensory epithelia of the macula utricle, but not in the crista ampullaris. Cells within the stroma (tissue underneath the sensory epithelia), utricle, and crista were also GFP-positive. Satellite cells in the vestibular ganglia were GFP-positive, while vestibular ganglia neurons were not. In the organ of Corti, GFP signal was found in inner border and inner phalangeal cells that surround the inner hair cells (GFP-negative), Dieters cells and cells in the great epithelial ridge. Outer hair cells were mildly positive for GFP. Satellite cells in the spiral ganglia were GFP-positive, while spiral ganglia neurons were not. Similar GFP expression was found in the vestibule and cochlea of animals at P15, however, outer hair cells showed no GFP expression. The inner ear of P60 animals contained moderate GFP expression in the stroma of the crista ampullaris and utricle, but not within the sensory epithelia. In the organ of Corti, moderate GFP expression was found in a few Deiters cells. The present data indicates that the expression of nestin in the mouse inner ear is developmentally regulated; yet in the adult inner ear there are some nestin expressing cells, suggesting an intrinsic repair potential, although to a more limited extent than during early post-natal life. √Ç¬© 2004 ISDN.

In a sample of 2,881 nest records collected by the lay public from 1959 to 1991, we examined whether clutch size has also responded to climate change. We found that clutch size is strongly related to lay date, both within and among years, and there has been no significant temporal variation in the slopes or intercepts of the clutch-size/lay-date regressions. As a consequence, we expected increases in clutch size with advancement in lay date; however, we detected no such trend over time. The distributions of egg-laying dates were more constricted in the warmest (and earliest) years, suggesting that changes in mean clutch size might be constrained by changes in the distribution of laying dates. If spring temperatures continue to increase, we predict further reductions of variance in laying dates and relatively small increases in clutch size. Such constraints on life-history variation probably are common and need to be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on reproduction in natural populations.

Grazing by geese on Carex ramenskii, one of the most abundant plant species throughout much of this region, appears to have increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was (i) to evaluate the effects of early-season defoliation and fertilization on plant growth and nutrient cycling processes within field plots of C. ramenskii over a 3-year period, and (ii) to study the interactive effects of defoliation, N availability, and salinity stress on growth, and biomass and N allocation in C. ramenskii under controlled, greenhouse conditions. Relative to control plots, clipped-fertilized plots showed significant increases in aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and leaf N concentration, resulting in significant increases in offtake biomass and offtake N during both 1991 and 1992. In the greenhouse, total production of clipped and unclipped plants did not differ, but clipped plants had significantly higher offtake biomass, and biomass and N allocation to offtake compared to undipped plants. Both field and laboratory experiments found that rapid regrowth following defoliation was dependent on soil nutrient availability. Fertilization increased soil respiration rates each year, but tended to decrease rates of net N mineralization, indicating that the soil microbial biomass is a strong nutrient sink in this ecosystem. In addition to the direct positive effects that goose feces have on plant growth, nitrogen recycled through feces may be an important source of nitrogen contributing to salinity tolerance in C. ramenskii. Our results also suggest that the observed increase in grazing pressure on patches of C. ramenskii early in the growing season may increase forage quality and quantity within these swards, and have important implications for geese-ecosystem interactions at a time of rapid goose population increase.",336,1,"excluded","Not birds"

Males spent more time at the nestbox, sang more songs and more song types during female presentations than during control periods (observation periods with no conspecifics). Males also sang more songs in the nestbox and flew more to the nestbox with green nest material. During male presentations, only the time spent at the nestbox and the carrying of nest material increased significantly. Males spent more time at the nestbox, sang more songs and more song types in response to a female stimulus than to a male stimulus. Males also sang more songs in the nestbox and flew more to the nestbox with nest material during female than during male presentations. These results suggest that the song and song repertoire of male starlings serve primarily an intersexual rather than an intrasex- ual function.

Alternatively, egg coloration may be selectively neutral because nest predators detect nests and not eggs, or it may be maladaptive because organisms are not always well adapted to their present environment. I evaluated these hypotheses by studying predation on artificial song thrush (Turdus philomelos) nests with quail eggs, painted either white, blue, or spotted (cryptic to a human eye). Corvids were the major nest predators. For concealed as well as exposed nests, I found no differences in the predation rates of nests with white, blue, or spotted eggs. Predators apparently detected the nests, and not the eggs, first. In a second experiment, I placed egg groups without nests in trees to study the effect of color per se. The predation rate of the spotted egg groups was significantly lower than that of the white and blue egg groups, for concealed as well as exposed egg groups.

Sediment pore water and bulk sediments from several lower Fox River sites were toxic to a number of test species including Pimephales promelas, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Hexagenia limbata, Selenastrum capricornutum, and Photobacterium phosphorum. An important component of the observed toxicity appeared to be due to ammonia. Evaluation of three bullhead (Ictalurus) species from the lower Fox River revealed an absence of preneoplastic or neoplastic liver lesions, and the Salmonella typhimurium bioassay indicated relatively little mutagenicity in sediment extracts. Apparent adverse reproductive effects were noted in two species of birds nesting along the lower Fox River and on a confined disposal facility for sediments near the mouth of the river, and there were measurable concentrations of potentially toxic 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) both in the birds and in sediments from several of the study sites.

Experiments presented here examined the specific egg parameters to which 'rejecter species' respond, the relative tolerances rejecters show towards nonmimetic eggs and the degree to which rejection is limited to eggs of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), the only parasitic bird widespread in North America. Relative to cowbird eggs, American robin (Turdus migratorius) eggs are larger, blue rather than white and immaculate rather than spotted. Experiments using 10 egg models at 137 nests showed that robins respond to each of these differences (Figs. 2 and 3) but do not usually reject an egg that deviates from their own by only one difference. Eggs that differ in ant two of the three parameters are usually rejected. This built-in tolerance reduces the likelihood that robins will reject their own eggs if these are atypical in size or coloration. Small egg size was the most important parameter eliciting rapid rejections (i.e. within 1 day), probably because differnces in size can be detected by both visual and tactile perception. By contrast, small egg size was the least important parameter determining whether eggs were eventually rejected (i.e. within 5 days, Tables 2 and 3). In terms of their eventual response, robins may be more sensitive to egg coloration than to size because the latter parameter is less reliable in distinguishing between robin and cowbird eggs. Experiments were also carried out at 37 nests of the gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), whose immaculate blue-green egg is only slightly larger than a cowbird egg. Catbirds are much more responsive to white ground color than to maculation (Table 4), perhaps because color is more reliable in distinguishing between catbird and cowbird eggs. Rejecter species exhibit degrees of tolerance towards foreign eggs that are proportional to the divergence between their eggs and those of the cowbird. Birds with eggs strongly divergent from cowbird eggs benefit from being relatively tolerant because they avoid rejecting their own eggs but still act against cowbird eggs. Species with cowbird-like eggs must be relatively intolerant to maximize the chances that cowbird eggs are rejected. Experiments show that rejection is not specific to cowbird eggs. Thus, birds have apparently responded evolutionarily to brood parasitism by developing recognition of their own eggs, rather than by developing recognition and rejection specific to parasitic eggs. √Ç¬© 1982 Springer-Verlag.",374,1,"excluded","No green nest material"

Investigations during 1965-68 attempted to study possible interactions existing between sheep and shearwaters on Big Green I., Furneaux Group, Tas. The island has been stocked with sheep for more than 100 years and during this period changes in vegetation and decreases in colony size have been noted. Exclusion of sheep from a portion of a colony did not increase hatching or fledging success, nor was there a decline in either the number of burrows or in burrow utilization, in the sheep-trampled areas. Indeed, sheep activity over colonies appeared to decline during the birds' breeding season and it was concluded that burrow damage was due mainly to the birds themselves, with major damage occurring in the fenced area during the breeding season. Comparison of burrow stability on Green Island with that in another colony, again suggested that birds were responsible for nest destruction but that renovation by the birds tended to nullify the importance of the damage. Though shearwater colonies were once considered to be more widespread on Green Island, experiments have indicated that the vegetation, induced by man and perpetuated by sheep, was not preventing burrow formation and expansion of colony areas. Sheep have not, therefore, been shown to be responsible for past declines and other factors will be considered later. √Ç¬© 1970, CSIRO. All rights reserved.",381,1,"excluded","Not experimental"

The Hawfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbill live primarily in woodland, the Greenfinch, Linnet and Goldfinch primarily in farmland, while the Bullfinch and Chaffinch breed, and occur throughout the year, in both these habitats. Habitat differences between species were probably more marked in primeval England than now, and the problems of studying animals in man√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩmodified environments are discussed in this context. Diet was studied by observation and by gut√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩanalyses of live and dead finches. Before roosting, finches usually accumulate food in their gullet, which is expandable but otherwise undifferentiated (the term √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcrop√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ is thus inappropriate). The Lesser Redpoll, the smallest species studied, can store up to about 0.8 c.c. of food in its gullet, but the Greenfinch, one of the largest finches, up to 2.5 c.c. Among the Carduelis finches, the Greenfinch lives mainly on the large seeds of various trees, cereal crops and agricultural weeds; the Goldfinch on the seeds of Compositae; the Siskin on alder and conifer seeds; the Lesser Redpoll on birch and other small seeds; and the Linnet on the seeds of various weeds of farmland. The Hawfinch and Bullfinch eat a greater proportion of buds and seeds from fleshy fruits than do other finches; but the Hawfinch prefers larger ones than does the Bullfinch. The three European crossbills feed almost entirely on conifer seeds; specializing on different tree species. In summer, the Chaffinch and Brambling live largely on invertebrates but in winter on beechmast or small seeds taken from the ground. In winter, Chaffinches reaching Britain from northern Europe tend to feed in large flocks in open areas and to roost communally, while residents tend to remain near their breeding places and roost singly. The migrations and distribution of finches in Europe are described briefly. At any time of winter, closely related species with similar feeding habits are often concentrated in different parts of a common wintering range. Furthermore, in some species, such as the Goldfinch and Chaffinch, the sexes winter mainly in different areas. In Oxford, food was least readily available during hard (winter) weather and there was then complete segregation in diet between different species, but at other times their diets often overlapped considerably. The overlap was much more pronounced in the species living in farmland (which is an artificial habitat) than in those living in natural or seminatural woodland; some tentative explanations for this are offered. The fringilline finches, the Chaffinch and Brambling, feed their young entirely on invertebrates, are territorial in the breeding season and collect food mostly within their territories. The cardueline finches, on the other hand, feed their young mainly, or entirely, on seeds, often nest in √¢‚Ç¨≈ìloose colonies√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ and usually gather food communally at some distance from their nests. The fringilline finches carry food in their bills to the young, which therefore receive small, but frequent, meals; whereas the carduelines feed their young by regurgitation and at longer intervals. Among the carduelines, the Hawfinch is exceptional in that seeds are first swallowed and regurgitated to the nestlings, whereas insects are carried in the bill. The Bullfinch develops in the breeding season special buccal pouches in which food is carried to the young. In general, most finches select diets for their young which differ from their own diets in the breeding season. The Crossbill and Linnet often feed their young on seeds alone, and some other species may do so occasionally. The breeding of these carduelines is therefore independent of a supply of invertebrates, but always coincides with an abundance of seeds. They breed at seasons when other birds do not; the most extreme cases are the three crossbills, which, given an abundance of suitable seeds, will nest at any time of year. The process of seed√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩhusking is described; the strength of the jaws, the extent of the gape and the width of the palatal grooves limit the size and hardness of seeds which a given species can take. No two species have bills of the same shape and size, and differences in diet between species are connected with differences in the structure of their bills and the way the bill is used. In general, the deeper the bill of a finch, the more numerous the types of seeds in its diet. The Greenfinch, Linnet and Redpoll have relatively short broad bills and feed more than do other Carduelis finches from plants whose seeds are relatively exposed (e.g. grasses) or enclosed within pods or capsules; they also pick up many fallen seeds from the ground, but each species concentrates on different sizes of seeds. The Goldfinch and Siskin have reIatively long, narrow bills and obtain much of their food by probing into cones and into the seed√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩheads of Com√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩpositae; unlike other finches, they also use a gaping movement while feeding. The Goldfinch has a longer bill and eats more Compositae seeds than the Siskin, while tlie latter eats more tree seeds than the Goldfinch. Further, male Goldfinches have slightly longer beaks than females, and hence can obtain teasel seeds more efficiently; females feed only rarely from these plants. The Bullfinch and Hawfinch obtain much of their food by crushing fruits, seed√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩheads, etc. in their bills and peeling off the outer layer to get the seeds. The methods used by the crossbill species to open cones of varying degrees of hardness are described in detail. The Chaffinch and Brambling obtain almost all their food by rapid pecks; they show none of the behaviour patterns used by carduelines to open various types of seed√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩheads. Species also differ in the proportion of food obtained from the ground, from vegetation, or on the wing. These differences are related to the various positions in which each species is able to feed. Those species (Goldfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbills) which are most adept at clinging and hanging feed mainly from trees and herbaceous plants, while those that are least adept at this (Chaffinch and Brambling) obtain almost all their food from the ground or from firm horizontal twigs. The remaining species are intermediate in the proportion of time spent feeding from the ground or from vegetation; and only the Chaffinch, Brambling and Bullfinch obtain an appreciable amount of food on the wing. Differences between species in the frequency with which various positions are adopted during feeding can be related to differences in their average body weights, and (to a lesser extent) in their leg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩstructure; the most agile species are either light in weight or have relatively short strong legs. Body√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩweight, leg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩproportions and bill√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩsize (and hence feeding habits) may vary considerably between different populations of the same species. In Appendix 2, the leg√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩproportions of certain English finches are compared with those of their German and Russian counterparts. Some finch species use their feet in coordination with their bill to obtain food. The extent to which various species do this in the wild is discussed in relation to the ease with which they can be taught experimentally to pull up food suspended on the end of a long thread. The ecology, structure and behaviour of finches is discussed in relation to some current ideas on speciation and the ontogeny of feeding behaviour. The young of several species of finches respond initially to a similar range of potential food√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩitems (both in size and appearance) and all attempt to deal with them in similar ways. However, each individual soon learns to concentrate on those foods it can obtain most efficiently with its own particular structures and behaviour patterns. It is thus the structural and behavioural differences between closely√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩrelated species which lead the individuals of each to prefer different foods. Further, some of the behaviour patterns themselves probably develop mainly as a result of learning conditioned by structure, so that some of the behavioural differences between species that affect food√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩchoice are in turn dependent on structural differences. This implies that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, two forms need diverge only in structure (and not necessarily √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpsychologically√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ) for some ecological segregation to be achieved. There are, however, certain differences in feeding behaviour between the fringillines and carduelines that cannot be attributed merely to structural differences between the two groups, so presumably some √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpsychological factor√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ is also important in the development of these particular behaviour patterns. A close relationship between the structure, feeding behaviour and food of an animal is usually taken for granted, but it is often difficult to decide which of these came first in evolution. Among finches, however, there are sometimes indications that a structural change was necessary before a new behaviour pattern or feeding habit could evolve, though further modification of structure may then occur through adaptation to the new foods thereby made available. Some evolutionary trends among finches are described, and the role of competition in the evolution and maintenance of ecological differences between species is discussed. The effect of social experience on feeding behaviour is also discussed, and some examples are given of the spread of novel food√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩhabits among finches, and of presumed traditional differences in feeding behaviour between different populations of the same species. Finally, some recent changes in food, and habitat√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩselection by finches are discussed in relation to problems of conservation. Copyright √Ç¬© 1967, Wiley Blackwell.

Here, we experimentally show a novel mechanism by which parents, through incorporation of aromatic herbs into nests, effectively modify their incubation behaviour to the benefit of their offspring. Our study species, the European starling, includes in its nest aromatic herbs which promote offspring fitness. We provided wild starlings with artificial nests including or excluding the typically selected fresh herbs and found strong support for our prediction of facilitated incubation. Herb effects were not explained by thermal changes of the nests per se, but by modified parental behaviours. Egg temperatures and nest attendance were higher in herb than herbless nests, egg temperatures dropped less frequently below critical thresholds and parents started their active day earlier. These effects were dynamic over time and particularly strong during early incubation. Incubation period was shorter in herb nests, and nestlings were heavier one week after hatching. Aromatic herbs hence influenced incubation in beneficial ways for offspring, possibly through pharmacological effects on incubating parents.",10,1,"selected",NA

Green plants and feathers of different colors have been hypothesized to play key roles in offspring protection against pathogens, and we here experimentally assessed spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) preferences for pigmented versus unpigmented feathers and for different green plants (aromatic vs. non-aromatic plants) as nest materials. We predicted a preferential selection of unpigmented feathers and aromatic plants according to the antimicrobial properties of these materials described in the literature. We evaluated these predictions during nest building and during egg-laying stages. As expected, starlings preferentially selected unpigmented feathers both before and during egg laying, while aromatic plants were preferentially selected only during the egg-laying stage. These results suggest that starlings prefer nest materials that enhance antimicrobial protection of their offspring.

Although mating with an attractive male may induce females to skew the sex ratio toward males, the balance between the benefits of producing attractive sons and the costs of competing with other females for mates could vary with female age, a possibility that had not been previously explored. In this paper we increment experimentally the attractiveness of males of the polygynous spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) by adding green plants to their nests, a trait involved in courtship, and look for female age-differential effects on offspring primary sex ratio. Young and middle aged females produced more sons in experimental than in control nests, as expected, but old females showed the opposite tendency. To explain this novel result, we speculate that older females are limited to produce the most costly sex because the physiological drawbacks imposed by ageing reduce their ability to compete with younger ones for the non-shareable resources offered by males. We discuss that this evolutionary scenario may be widespread in avian polygynous systems. √Ç¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",28,2,"selected",NA

Although experimental studies have shown that female birds may adjust offspring sex ratios in response to changes in their own condition and in the external appearance of their mate, and male attributes other than his external morphology are also thought to act as signals of male quality, it is not known whether females will respond to changes in such signals, in the absence of any change in the appearance of the male himself. Here, we experimentally manipulated a male courtship display, the green plants carried to the nest by male spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor), without changing any physical attributes of the male himself, and examined whether this influenced female decisions on offspring sex ratio. We found that in an environment in which female starlings were producing more daughters than sons, experimental enhancement of the green nesting material caused females to significantly increase the number of male eggs produced and thereby removed the female bias. This effect was consistent in 2 years and at two localities. This demonstrates that the green material, whose function has long puzzled biologists, conveys important information to the female and that she facultatively adjusts offspring production accordingly. √Ç¬© 2004 The Royal Society.",32,2,"selected",NA

They can modify the bacterial and parasitic environment of the nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual signalling processes. In spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, green plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored these effects in two different populations, together with the potential effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres. Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of staphylococci on the skin of 8-day-old nestlings was negatively related to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these experimental effects. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We supplemented aromatic plants to half of a sample of nests, while adding grass to the other half of nests. We quantified abundance of two groups of blood-sucking flies (blackflies and biting midges) at two different stages of the reproductive period, and abundance of three nest-dwelling ectoparasites (fleas, mites, and blowflies). Experimental supplementation of aromatic plants reduced abundance of fleas only in nests of yearling females and not in nests of older females. Blackflies and biting midges were both more numerous in nests of yearling females than in nests of older females. Mass of aromatic plants added by females was negatively related with abundance of fleas in control nests but not in experimental nests supplied with aromatic plants. Mass of plants added by females was also positively related with abundance of blackflies during the nestling stage. Finally, aromatic plants did not affect nestling growth or immune responses.

In a field study, we investigated whether these herbs affect the mite and bacteria load of the nests and the condition of the nestlings either directly or via parasite control. We examined the amount of herbs and the number of plant species males carried into their nests, the variation of volatile compounds in the headspace air of the nest boxes and mite/bacteria load of the nests throughout the season. The amount of herb material and the number of plant species, the number of substances emanated by these plants and the infestation of the nests with bacteria and mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) increased with season. In a field experiment, we exchanged natural starling nests with experimental nests with or without herbs. We found that the herbs had no effect on the mites but fewer bacteria were sampled in nests with herbs than in nests without herbs. The body mass of the fledging was not related to the season or the mite/bacteria load of the nests. However, nestlings from nests with herbs fledged with higher body mass than nestlings from nests without herbs. Both bacteria and mite load were related to nestling mortality. In nests containing no herbs, the numbers of fledglings declined significantly with the increasing mite load while the mites had no effect on the number of fledglings in nests with herbs. Thus, the nest herbs counteracted the effect of the mites. In conclusion, it seems that volatile herbs can reduce bacterial but not mite infestation of the starling nests. The positive influence of herbs on nestling growth indicates that herbs either directly (perhaps as immunostimulants) improve the condition of the nestlings and help them cope with the harmful effects of mites, or they provide a nest environment beneficial for the nestlings' development by the reduction of germs. √Ç¬© Dt.
