Abstract = {The blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) is one of a few known passerine birds
   that incorporate fresh fragments of aromatic plants in their nest during
   the nesting period. In this study, we experimentally tested whether
   aromatic plants in blue tit nests affect physiological condition of
   nestlings as indicated by hemoglobin and glucose in the blood. Nestlings
   in nests supplemented with fresh, aromatic plants had elevated blood
   hemoglobin, and therefore improved physiological condition, as compared
   with control nestlings. There was no difference between nestlings in two
   contrasting habitats (urban parkland and forest). Although mean levels
   of blood glucose did not differ between treatment and control nestlings,
   the blood of forest nestlings contained more glucose than the blood of
   parkland nestlings, which indicates poorer health for forest nestlings.
   In general, knowledge of the effects of incorporating fresh green,
   aromatic plant material into avian nests on physiological condition of
   nestlings is still fragmentary and more experimental studies are needed.},

Abstract = {Some passerines incorporate aromatic plants in their nest cups, and
   several hypotheses have been formulated to explain this behaviour. One
   of those, the Drug Hypothesis, states that aromatic plants present in
   nests have positive effects on nestlings' development through increased
   immune function. In this study, we aimed to examine if experimental
   addition of aromatic plants had positive effects on reproductive
   performance (the number of fledglings produced and nestling survival
   rate) and nestling development (weight and tarsus length). In addition,
   we study whether those potential effects were more noticeable in
   different brood sizes-small and large-through an observational approach.
   We expect that large broods, due to increased resource competition
   between nestlings, will benefit more from aromatic plant incorporation,
   as compared to small broods. Nestlings were significantly heavier in
   2015 as compared to 2016 and 2017 and in small broods. No effect of
   treatment was observed in nestling weight. Although there was no overall
   effect of treatment on nestling tarsus length, nestlings from aromatic
   nests had significantly longer tarsi as compared to nestlings from
   control nests, in large broods.},

Abstract = {Although the use of olfaction by birds is now widely recognised, the
   olfactory abilities of passerine birds remain poorly explored, for
   historical reasons. Several studies however suggest that passerines can
   perceive volatile compounds in several biologically relevant contexts.
   In Corsica, recent findings suggest that cavity-nesting blue tits may
   use volatile compounds in the context of nest building and maintenance.
   Although they build their nests mainly from moss, female blue tits also
   frequently incorporate fragments of several species of aromatic plants
   in the nest cup. In field experiments, breeding female blue tits altered
   their nest maintenance behaviour in response to experimental addition of
   aromatic plants in their nest. In aviary experiments. captive male blue
   tits could be trained to detect lavender odour from a distance. Here I
   report results from a field study aimed to test whether adult blue tits
   altered their chick-feeding behaviour after an experimental change in
   nest odour composition. I experimentally added fragments of aromatic
   plant species that differed from those brought in the nests before the
   start of the experiment in a set of experimental nests and added moss,
   the basic nest material, in a set of control nests. Both male and female
   blue tits hesitated significantly longer entering the nest cavity after
   addition of new aromatic plant fragments, as compared to moss addition.
   This response was especially observed during the first visit following
   the experimental change in nest plant composition. Nest composition
   treatment had no effect on the time spent in the nest. This study
   demonstrates that free-ranging blue tits detect changes in nest odour
   from outside the nest cavity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Neural Correlates of Behavioural Olfactory Sensitivity Changes
   Seasonally in European Starlings},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background: Possibly due to the small size of the olfactory bulb (OB) as
   compared to rodents, it was generally believed that songbirds lack a
   well-developed sense of smell. This belief was recently revised by
   several studies showing that various bird species, including passerines,
   use olfaction in many respects of life. During courtship and nest
   building, male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) incorporate
   aromatic herbs that are rich in volatile compounds (e. g., milfoil,
   Achillea millefolium) into the nests and they use olfactory cues to
   identify these plants. Interestingly, European starlings show seasonal
   differences in their ability to respond to odour cues: odour sensitivity
   peaks during nest-building in the spring, but is almost non-existent
   during the non-breeding season.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used repeated in vivo
   Manganese-enhanced MRI to quantify for the first time possible seasonal
   changes in the anatomy and activity of the OB in starling brains. We
   demonstrated that the OB of the starling exhibits a functional seasonal
   plasticity of certain plant odour specificity and that the OB is only
   able to detect milfoil odour during the breeding season. Volumetric
   analysis showed that this seasonal change in activity is not linked to a
   change in OB volume. By subsequently experimentally elevating
   testosterone (T) in half of the males during the non-breeding season we
   showed that the OB volume was increased compared to controls.
   Conclusions/Significance: By investigating the neural substrate of
   seasonal olfactory sensitivity changes we show that the starlings' OB
   loses its ability during the non-breeding season to detect a natural
   odour of a plant preferred as green nest material by male starlings. We
   found that testosterone, applied during the non-breeding season, does
   not restore the discriminatory ability of the OB but has an influence on
   its size.},

Abstract = {Male European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, incorporate fresh volatile
   herbs into their nests. This behaviour is related to courtship but also
   benefits the nestlings. We tested in aviary experiments whether males
   select aromatic plants using olfaction and whether they depend on
   experience with nest odours they encountered as nestlings. We scented
   nests of wild starlings with milfoil, Achillea millefolium, a preferred
   nest plant of the starlings, and other control nests with vanilla.
   Fledglings from both nest types were hand- reared and tested the
   following year in dyadic choice experiments for their odour preference.
   Males from both milfoi-land vanilla- treated nests preferred milfoil
   scent when they had the choice between milfoil- scented versus vanilla-
   scented or versus unscented leaves. However, when they had to choose
   between vanilla scent and no scent, males from vanilla- treated nests
   chose vanilla scent but males from milfoil- treated nests did not
   discriminate. The disinterest of vanilla- inexperienced males in
   vanilla- scented leaves ( when milfoil scent was lacking) and the
   preference for it in vanilla- experienced males implies learning during
   the nestling period. Because males discriminated between leaves of the
   same plant species looking the same but scented with different odours
   and because males without milfoil experience instantly preferred milfoil
   odour, we conclude that starlings use olfactory cues to select green
   nest material following an olfactory pattern designed prior to birth
   which may be supplemented by learning early in ontogeny.},

Title = {Light matters: Nest illumination alters egg rejection behavior in a
   cavity-nesting bird},
Journal = {AVIAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Abstract = {Egg discrimination by cavity-nesting birds that build nests under dim
   light conditions was presumed to depend on nest luminance, although this
   hypothesis has rarely been tested. Tests of egg discrimination ability
   by cavity nesting tits under dim light conditions may reveal the
   selection pressure from brood parasitism that they encounter under
   natural interactions. We manipulated the intensity of luminance of nests
   of the Green-backed Tit (Parus monticolus), a potential cuckoo host that
   possesses a strong discrimination ability of non-mimetic foreign eggs.
   We performed experiments to test their egg discrimination ability under
   different light conditions. Our results showed that Green-backed Tits
   discriminate against non-mimetic foreign eggs under normal light
   conditions in nest boxes, and this ability persisted at nest luminance
   as low as 4.78 +/- 1.31 lux that is several times lower than normal
   luminance (38.11 +/- 24.02 lux). However, egg discrimination by
   Green-backed Tits disappeared when nest luminance was reduced to a
   minimum of 0.35 +/- 0.15 lux. The latter value represents total darkness
   for humans. The present study shows that nest luminance plays a key role
   in egg discrimination by Green-backed Tits that build nests under dim
   light conditions. This study provides strong experimental evidence for
   nest illumination altering egg rejection behavior in cavity-nesting
   birds.},

Title = {The Influence of Different Light Wavelengths of Anthropogenic Light at
   Night on Nestling Development and the Timing of Post-fledge Movements in
   a Migratory Songbird},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Many different aspects of an animal's lifecycle such as its behavior,
   patterns of hormone activity, and internal clock time, can be affected
   by anthropogenic light at night (ALAN). Exposing an organism to ALAN
   during its early life could also have an impact on its development.
   Since photoperiod can trigger or schedule the migration timing of
   long-distance migratory birds, there is great potential for
   anthropogenic light to interact with photoperiod to affect timing.
   However, very little has been investigated regarding the impacts of ALAN
   on post-hatching development and migration timing. We investigated the
   impact of ALAN during nestling development in a long-distance migratory
   songbird to determine the potential impact on the timing of
   post-breeding movements in the wild. We experimentally manipulated the
   light by using programmable lighting, in the nest boxes of free-living
   nestlings of purple martin (Progne subis) in Manitoba, Canada. We
   exposed two groups of developing nestlings, from hatch to fledge date,
   to green or white LED lights (5 lux) during the night. We also included
   a control group that experienced natural, ambient light at night. We
   found that some adults abandoned their nests shortly after starting the
   experiment (4 of 15 nests in the white light treatment). For the nests
   that remained active, nestlings exposed to the white light treatment had
   higher weights (at day 20 or 22), later fledge dates (1.54 +/- 0.37,
   95\% CI 0.80-2.28), and later colony departure date (2.84 +/- 1.00, 95\%
   CI 0.88-4.81), than young of the control group. Moreover, nestlings of
   both white and green light groups had longer nesting duration than
   nestlings of the control group. This study demonstrates the impact of
   ALAN on the development of post-breeding movement timing in nestlings of
   wild migratory birds. However, our results also indicate that green
   light may have less of an impact as compared to white light.},

Abstract = {Land management may combine with air temperature to influence the
   persistence of animal populations, so both must be evaluated in concert
   to understand how populations respond to increased forest management
   intensity and projected climate change. We used a large-scale study that
   experimentally manipulated herbicide application intensity within
   regenerating forests to test how herbicide-mediated changes in
   temperature influenced three components of reproductive output in the
   House Wren (Troglodytes aedon): nest survival, the number of offspring
   produced, and nestling body condition. We found no evidence for a
   consistent herbicide treatment effect on any reproductive measure,
   although our power to detect effects was modest. Relative to unsprayed
   controls, nest survival was lowest in the light herbicide treatment, and
   this measure increased on sites that were subjected to greater herbicide
   application (i.e., at moderate and intensive herbicide treatments),
   against our predictions. We also detected no evidence of a temperature
   effect singly or in combination with herbicide application on wren
   reproductive output. Although herbicide intensity was more influential
   on reproductive output than was temperature, we found that neither
   exerted strong effects in regenerating conifer forests. Given the dearth
   of studies that combine evaluations of temperature and land management
   impacts on songbird reproductive output, we suggest researchers continue
   to expand our understanding of the relative influence of both drivers
   simultaneously to better formulate conservation strategies in light of
   expected changes in climate and a heightened global demand for wood
   products.},

Abstract = {1. Rearing environments can shape offspring phenotype across taxa, yet
   little is known about how brood size influences hypothalamic-pituitary
   axis functioning, whether its expression trades off with growth, and the
   degree to which these -relationships vary between species.
   2. We evaluated how brood size influenced nestling physiological
   (glucocorticoids) and somatic traits (growth), and the extent to which
   their relationship differed between two closely related, sympatric
   songbirds when experiencing identical rearing environments.
   Specifically, we used a cross-fostering approach to alter brood size and
   create an experimental gradient of nestmate competition, and then tested
   whether experimentally manipulated brood sizes resulted in nestlings
   with altered concentrations of corticosterone and whether corticosterone
   responses traded off with growth.
   3. Nestlings of both species experienced elevated concentrations of
   baseline and stressor-induced corticosterone when raised in enlarged
   broods, relative to control and reduced broods, but neither measurement
   was found to trade off with growth or be linked to survival to fledging.
   4. In contrast, we found divergence in the magnitude of the
   corticosterone stress response between species across all brood
   treatments, with greater stressor-induced corticosterone concentrations
   found in the Violet-green Swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) relative to
   the closely related Tree Swallow (T. bicolor).
   5. Our study demonstrated that brood size can lead to changes in
   offspring corticosterone concentrations in swallows and that nestlings
   of sympatric species, even those that are closely related and
   ecologically similar, can diverge in their corticosterone stress
   response when experiencing identical rearing conditions.
   6. We conclude that corticosterone appears to play a key role for
   balancing energetic demands that arise in the face of nestmate
   competition in Tachycineta swallows and that elevated concentrations of
   corticosterone may enhance offspring survival during challenging
   environmental conditions, such as when brood competition is strong.},

Abstract = {Development of avian embryos requires thermal energy, usually from
   parents. Parents may, however, trade off catering for embryonic
   requirements against their own need to forage through intermittent
   incubation. This dynamically adjusted behaviour can be affected by
   properties of the nest. Here, we experimentally show a novel mechanism
   by which parents, through incorporation of aromatic herbs into nests,
   effectively modify their incubation behaviour to the benefit of their
   offspring. Our study species, the European starling, includes in its
   nest aromatic herbs which promote offspring fitness. We provided wild
   starlings with artificial nests including or excluding the typically
   selected fresh herbs and found strong support for our prediction of
   facilitated incubation. Herb effects were not explained by thermal
   changes of the nests per se, but by modified parental behaviours. Egg
   temperatures and nest attendance were higher in herb than herbless
   nests, egg temperatures dropped less frequently below critical
   thresholds and parents started their active day earlier. These effects
   were dynamic over time and particularly strong during early incubation.
   Incubation period was shorter in herb nests, and nestlings were heavier
   one week after hatching. Aromatic herbs hence influenced incubation in
   beneficial ways for offspring, possibly through pharmacological effects
   on incubating parents.},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The avian nest is an essential structure for offspring development. For
   adults, nest building entails costs in terms of time, energy, and
   exposure to predators and parasites. Amount and diversity of materials
   used for nest building depend on their availability and functionality in
   scenarios of sexual selection and parasitism. Green plants and feathers
   of different colors have been hypothesized to play key roles in
   offspring protection against pathogens, and we here experimentally
   assessed spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) preferences for pigmented
   versus unpigmented feathers and for different green plants (aromatic vs.
   non-aromatic plants) as nest materials. We predicted a preferential
   selection of unpigmented feathers and aromatic plants according to the
   antimicrobial properties of these materials described in the literature.
   We evaluated these predictions during nest building and during
   egg-laying stages. As expected, starlings preferentially selected
   unpigmented feathers both before and during egg laying, while aromatic
   plants were preferentially selected only during the egg-laying stage.
   These results suggest that starlings prefer nest materials that enhance
   antimicrobial protection of their offspring. We also discuss some other,
   non-exclusive functions that might explain the observed preference for
   nest materials, especially with regard to their potential role in sexual
   signaling.},

Abstract = {1. Glucocorticoid steroid hormones play a central role in regulating the
   metabolic state of animals, especially when they cope with unanticipated
   stressors in their environment. The cort-adaptation hypothesis predicts
   that baseline concentrations of glucocorticoids are adjusted upward to
   match energetic needs and promote fitness when individuals are faced
   with physiological challenges, including those associated with
   reproduction.
   2. We tested the cort-adaptation hypothesis in the violet-green swallow
   (Tachycineta thalassina) by experimentally increasing flight costs
   during the offspring rearing period. Individual females were assigned to
   one of three treatments: light feather clipping (removal of four wing
   feathers), heavy feather clipping (removal of eight wing feathers) or a
   sham-clip control.
   3. We measured baseline corticosterone and body mass immediately prior
   to implementing treatments during the offspring rearing period and then
   10 days after initial manipulations took place. We also quantified
   risk-taking behaviour, offspring feeding rate and the number of
   offspring fledged. Finally, we examined how treatments influenced
   offspring phenotype via measurements of nestling body mass and baseline
   corticosterone, as both measures have been associated with post-fledging
   survival.
   4. We found that handicapped females significantly increased baseline
   corticosterone between the two sampling periods, with the magnitude of
   change in the light clipping and heavy clipping treatments 2.59 and 6.19
   greater than controls, respectively. All individuals lost mass between
   the two sampling periods, but the degree of loss was greater for females
   in both clipping treatments relative to unmanipulated controls.
   5. In contrast, we found no evidence of treatment differences in female
   risk-taking, offspring provisioning or in the number of offspring
   fledged. Offspring raised by females in both handicapped treatments did
   have significantly elevated baseline corticosterone relative to those in
   control broods, but we detected no treatment differences in offspring
   body mass.
   6. Our study found that handicapped females increased circulating
   glucocorticoids and were able to maintain critical parental care
   behaviours and raise a similar number of offspring as unmanipulated
   controls. Thus, increases in baseline cort of handicapped females
   appeared to have allowed them to maintain fitness despite increased
   physiological challenges, providing support for the cort-adaptation
   hypothesis.},

Title = {Nonsystemic fungal endophytes increase survival but reduce tolerance to
   simulated herbivory in subarctic Festuca rubra},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Plant-microbial symbioses are widespread in nature and can shape the
   ecology and evolution of hosts and interacting symbionts. Fungal
   endophytes-fungi that live asymptomatically within plant tissues-are a
   pervasive group of symbionts well known for their role in mediating
   host-responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, they also may
   become pathogenic and often impose metabolic costs on hosts. Here, we
   examine the role of fungal endophytes in mediating responses of the host
   grass red fescue (Festuca rubra) to salt and herbivore stress. We
   collected 38 red fescue genotypes from within its native range on
   Akimiski Island, Nunavut, Canada, where it occurs in the supratidal
   region on the northern part of the island and is heavily grazed by
   nesting and brood--rearing snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens)
   and Canada geese (Branta canadensis). We screened all plants for the
   presence of the systemic endophyte Epichloe festucae and sequenced the
   nonsystemic endophytic community on a subset of these plants. While we
   did not detect E. festucae, our plants instead were host to a diverse
   array of nonsystemic fungal endophytes. We then conducted a fully
   factorial greenhouse experiment where we crossed plant genotype (4
   levels) with simulated grazing (clipped or unclipped), endophyte status
   (present or absent) and salinity (0, 32 or 64 ppt) to examine the
   ecological role of this endophytic community. Overall, the presence of
   nonsystemic endophytes increased plant survival, but only in the absence
   of salt or clipping. On the other hand, these endophytes reduced plant
   tolerance to simulated herbivory by 69\% but had no effect on
   aboveground plant growth. Thus, our results identify a potential
   nonsystemic endophyte-mediated trade-off in host plant survival and
   tolerance to herbivory and suggest this trade-off may be altered by
   stressful abiotic conditions.},

Title = {Paternal attractiveness and the effects of differential allocation of
   parental investment},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {69-78},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The differential allocation hypothesis (DAH) predicts that an individual
   should vary its reproductive investment according to the attractiveness
   of its mate. A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that
   investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive
   males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for
   offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting
   poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and
   the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male
   attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive
   stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two
   aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red
   leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males
   received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for
   assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an
   experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality,
   so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality.
   Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow
   differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch
   and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment
   were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen
   ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and
   incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses
   than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed
   group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring
   performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and
   biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment
   patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness
   appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not
   consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that
   the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals
   and across contexts. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {Nest Material Shapes Eggs Bacterial Environment},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Selective pressures imposed by pathogenic microorganisms to embryos have
   selected in hosts for a battery of antimicrobial lines of defenses that
   includes physical and chemical barriers. Due to the antimicrobial
   properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of
   feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for
   nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However,
   experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the
   literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally the
   effects of these nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria
   (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and
   Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of spotless starlings (Sturnus
   unicolor) at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period. This
   was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We
   also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and
   artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on
   eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial
   function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location
   with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial
   effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial
   nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of
   incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and
   unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests
   and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to
   discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected
   association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of
   feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results
   considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of
   feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the
   importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation
   associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength
   of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds
   should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments
   during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.},

Abstract = {Greenery added to birds' nests is a sexually selected trait of males
   that entails costs for females. Why some birds add green plants to their
   nests has long puzzled biologists. Some studies suggest that this
   behavior is promoted by natural selection because of its positive
   effects on nestling health. However, if greenery functions as a sexually
   selected signal of male attractiveness, it may promote costly female
   competition for preferred males. We experimentally increased the amount
   of plants in spotless starling's nests, causing a reduction in the
   number of recruits. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to
   explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian
   species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly
   understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses,
   adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate
   positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship
   hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected
   signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for
   preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally
   increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of
   spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the
   natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and
   explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition
   and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number
   of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually
   antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative
   on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of
   local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that
   the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex
   short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and
   recruitment success.},

Abstract = {The use of aromatic plants and their essential oils for ectoparasite
   treatment is a field of growing interest. Several species of birds
   regularly introduce aromatic herbs into their nests putatively to reduce
   parasites. The behaviour is most often seen in cavity nesting birds and
   after nest building has finished. The plants are included in a
   non-structural manner and are often strongly aromatic. Various different
   hypotheses have been proposed regarding the function of this behaviour;
   from the plants altering some non-living factor in the nest (crypsis,
   water loss and insulation hypotheses) to them being involved in mate
   selection (mate hypothesis) or even having a beneficial effect, direct
   or indirect, on chicks (drug or nest protection hypothesis, NPH). Many
   studies have been carried out over the years observing and
   experimentally testing these hypotheses. This review focuses on studies
   involving the most popular of these hypotheses, the NPH: that plants
   decrease nest parasites or pathogens, thereby conveying positive effects
   to the chicks, allowing the behaviour to evolve. Studies providing
   observational evidence towards this hypothesis and those experimentally
   testing it are discussed.},

Abstract = {Besides the direct functionality of nests driven by natural selection,
   accumulating evidence shows that nest building behaviors and nests may
   also evolve under sexual selection. Empirical research on the potential
   role of nests or nest features as sexual signals, however, is
   comparatively scarce for avian species in which the female is the only
   sex involved in its construction because of a male bias in the study of
   sexual traits, even though maternally built nests may be more common
   than paternally and biparentally built nests. In blue tits Cyanistes
   caeruleus, females alone build nests and add aromatic plants to them. We
   manipulated nest size and amount of aromatic plants in the nest to
   assess subsequent male effort and risk taking during provisioning of
   nestlings as indices of differential allocation. Risk taking was
   assessed through trappability indices of males at the nest-box when
   provisioning nestlings. Although male provisioning rates did not differ
   between experimental groups, male risk taking during provisioning was
   significantly lower in nests reduced in size than in control and
   enlarged nests, and it was significantly higher in nests supplied with
   aromatic plants than in control nests. Females showed nonsignificant
   trends to increase their provisioning effort in reduced nests, probably
   to compensate reduced male investment. Finally, female provisioning
   rates and especially male risk taking had a major positive impact on
   reproductive success and thereby on female fitness. In summary, this
   study (and previous evidence) suggests that nest size and aromatic
   plants in blue tit nests are used by females as sexual signals to elicit
   differential allocation in males. This study adds to the scarce evidence
   in favor of nests or nest materials acting as sexually selected traits
   regarding female signaling.},

Abstract = {Male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) use odorous herbs as green
   nest material. They show these plants to females to catch their
   attention before they incorporate them into their nests. Nestlings
   reared in nests containing herbs carry fewer bacteria, have higher
   haematocrit levels and more basophile leucocytes, and have a higher
   fledging weight than those reared in nests without herbs. The incubation
   temperature is higher in nests with herbs than in herbless nests.
   Females are attracted by herb nests and herb nests provide energy-saving
   benefits to incubating females. In choice experiments, starlings
   employed olfaction to select nest herbs, using innate information and
   experience acquired as nestlings to identify odours. Measures of head
   space air in starling nest boxes revealed an increase of volatile
   substances during the nestlings phase. Manganese-enhanced resonance
   imaging of the olfactory bulb of starling showed that the neural
   correlates of olfactory sensitivity change seasonally. Starlings can
   only discriminate odours during the reproductive season. The association
   between odour perception and reproductive behaviour suggests that
   increased testosterone production, related to the increasing photoperiod
   in spring, may guide these seasonal changes. The size of the olfactory
   bulb but not its ability to discriminate was affected by testosterone
   implants in the non-reproductive season.},

Abstract = {The males of the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and Spotless
   Starling (S. unicolor) carry green plants to their nests. However, the
   consequences of this behaviour for the females are still poorly known.
   In this study, we evaluated the behavioural responses of female Spotless
   Starlings to the green plants that they find in their nests. We added
   green plants to a group of experimental nests (E nests) and quantified
   the activity of the nesting females in the E nests and in a group of
   non-manipulated nests (C nests). The females never added green plants to
   their nests, but they removed the green plants more frequently from the
   E nests than from the C nests. The number of departures from the nest by
   females that carried green plants was positively correlated with the
   number of visits by females that carried nothing. In contrast, the
   number of departures by females carrying green plants was uncorrelated
   with the number of visits made by females that carried nest-building
   materials. These results suggest that the females made a specific
   additional effort to remove the green plants from the E nests. We
   propose that this behaviour may be an adaptive response of mated females
   that serves to counteract the eventual negative effects of green plants
   on their reproductive success. However, competing hypotheses cannot be
   rejected, and additional work is needed to better understand the removal
   of green plants by female Spotless Starlings.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of an herbal

   the chemical composition of broiler chickens' bones in reference to
   antibiotic growth promoter. The experimental material was provided by
   180 ROSS broiler chickens. One-day-old nestlings were divided randomly
   into 2 control groups and 4 experimental groups, in three replications,
   10 birds each. The feed mixtures (Starter and Grower/Finisher types)
   were made of corn and extracted soy meal and they also contained fodder
   yeast, soy oil, mineral additives, premixes (with an addition of growth
   promoters or without) and an addition of dried green forage or dried
   herbs. The mechanical properties of the bones were determined on the
   basis of the three-point bend test performed with the use of an Instron
   4302 apparatus coupled with a computer. The test registers as a graph
   the dependence between the force acting perpendicularly to the long axis
   of the bone and its deformation. An examination was performed to
   determine maximum force, and the maximum elasticity force. The studies
   revealed that both the type and the amount of the herbs determined
   chickens' growth and the physical and strength properties of their
   bones. The most beneficial effects were observed in feeding birds
   mixtures containing 1\% of pansy, since the values noted for all traits
   and indices were not worse than the effects obtained in the control
   group receiving antibiotic growth promoter, and in some cases they were
   even higher. The least positive results occurred in supplementing feed

Abstract = {Allocation rules between ornamental and other functional traits of birds
   may differ among individuals and vary with environmental conditions. We
   supplemented roller (Coracias garrulus) nestlings with methionine in a
   between-nest design to investigate the way in which the sex and position
   in the hatching hierarchy affect the allocation of resources among
   growth, immunity, and plumage coloration. Methionine induces the
   production of lymphocytes at expense of growth; thus, we used it to
   manipulate growth and immunity, which are two traits likely to
   compromise plumage coloration. We predicted that late-hatched chicks
   within a brood (juniors) compared to early-hatched chicks (seniors)
   should allocate more to traits directly providing fitness than to
   ornamental traits because juniors are more affected than seniors by
   sibling competition. The methionine treatment effectively enhanced the
   production of lymphocytes in experimental broods. This appeared to be at
   the expense of plumage coloration in junior nestlings because, in
   supplemented nests, junior males showed a trend to display less greenish
   bellies than junior males from control nests. However, juniors from
   supplemented nests maintained wing growth as in control juniors. The
   plumage coloration of seniors was unaffected by the methionine
   supplementation, although they paid the costs of lymphocyte production
   at a level of growth that was reduced compared to senior nestlings in
   control nests. Hence, sex, and hatching order affected resource
   allocation among growth, immunity, and plumage coloration of roller
   nestlings. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of

Abstract = {Multiple male traits and displays may act in signalling sexually
   selected processes during courtship. Spotless starling males (Sturnus
   unicolor) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and
   recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female
   breeding decisions and the production of male-biased broods. Although
   the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear,
   data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones.
   Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence
   of the increased female-female competition generated by the increase in
   male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same
   manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to
   result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings.
   We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating
   testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an
   increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of
   the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow
   females to maintain their mating status when competing with other
   females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased
   the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting
   plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We
   propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone
   levels, male-biased sex ratios and female resource-holding potential in
   intra-sexual competition in this species.},

Abstract = {In birds, female egg allocation patterns have a strong influence in
   offspring development and differential investment in egg size and
   composition has been shown to respond to male attractiveness. In this
   study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male
   starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in
   some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted
   that, if female investment before laying is related to male
   attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive
   investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when
   compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused
   variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to
   influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid
   larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was
   added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the
   experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in
   experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments.
   Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher
   testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs
   laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch
   level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for
   hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other
   females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen
   as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as
   we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg
   characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen
   concentration.},

Abstract = {Although many avian eggs appear to be cryptically colored, many species
   also lay vibrant blue green eggs. This seemingly conspicuous coloration
   has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor
   reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual
   signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a
   signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual
   selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying
   more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed
   support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in
   cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg
   coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited.
   In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially
   nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample
   opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of
   other females. We used correlational data and an experimental
   manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual
   signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to
   females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female
   quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to
   offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches
   with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these
   predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In
   light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to
   consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg
   coloration.},

Abstract = {The spatial, habitat and dietary overlap of two breeding goose species
   was studied in Sassendalen, Svalbard, in summer 2003 based on abundance
   within 500 x 500-m grid squares and faecal diet analyses during
   pre-breeding, nesting and post-hatching periods. More than half of all
   Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus occurred in the absence of
   Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis during nesting and post-hatching periods
   compared to c. 20\% when concentrated by pre-breeding snow cover. In
   contrast, only 5\% of Barnacle Geese were observed in the absence of
   Pink-footed Geese pre-breeding, 15\% during nesting, and 35\%
   post-hatching. Among six defined habitat types, Barnacle Geese resorted
   more to `upland' habitats during pre-breeding and nesting and to lowland
   lakes post-hatching when compared to Pink-footed Geese. Although
   Pink-footed Geese showed less change in seasonal habitat preference,
   many shifted to the river valley bottom post-hatching, giving access to
   open water (predator avoidance) and lush green vegetation (foraging for
   goslings). The smallest extent of distributional overlap between the two
   species occurred post-hatching, but each species was also highly
   restricted by snow cover during pre-nesting. The greatest extent of
   overlap in distribution and diet occurred during incubation, when large
   dietary variation between different breeding valleys reflected local
   food availability around nests (probably a result of nest-site
   preference rather than food selection per se). Whether this means that
   increased interactions within and between the two goose species with
   future increases in local density are most likely to be manifest at this
   stage of the summer is impossible to determine without knowledge of
   available food resources and manipulative experiments. More detailed
   investigations of the effects of foraging by both species on plant
   structure, quality and community composition are necessary to predict
   likely outcomes of future changes in population densities of both
   species.},

Abstract = {It has been proposed that blue-green egg colouration in certain avian
   species has evolved as a signal of female and egg quality to males,
   affecting their investment in the brood according to the differential
   allocation scenario. A recent experiment has successfully manipulated
   male investment by placing dummy eggs simulating the extremes in the
   blue-green natural reflectance. Here we have substituted one egg in
   certain pied flycatcher clutches with a single deep-blue (blue) or
   light-blue (pale) dummy egg and used other clutches as controls. Blue
   dummy eggs reflected more in the blue-green part of the spectrum than
   natural and pale dummy eggs, which were similar in reflectance.
   Nestlings in nests with one blue dummy egg during laying and incubation
   attained a significantly higher mass and condition than those in nests
   with one pale dummy egg or in control broods, when controlling for
   phenology, brood size and blue-green chroma of the clutch. Only a shift
   in parental investment can have induced this highly significant effect.
   Preference for deeply coloured clutches associated with high-quality

Abstract = {Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that avian females are able
   to manipulate the offspring sex ratio at birth. Although mating with an
   attractive male may induce females to skew the sex ratio toward males,
   the balance between the benefits of producing attractive sons and the
   costs of competing with other females for mates could vary with female
   age, a possibility that had not been previously explored. In this paper
   we increment experimentally the attractiveness of males of the
   polygynous spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) by adding green plants
   to their nests, a trait involved in courtship, and look for female
   age-differential effects on offspring primary sex ratio. Young and
   middle aged females produced more sons in experimental than in control
   nests, as expected, but old females showed the opposite tendency. To
   explain this novel result, we speculate that older females are limited
   to produce the most costly sex because the physiological drawbacks
   imposed by ageing reduce their ability to compete with younger ones for
   the non-shareable resources offered by males. We discuss that this
   evolutionary scenario may be widespread in avian polygynous systems.},

Abstract = {Organisms frequently encounter stressful ecological conditions. In
   vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is
   mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in
   increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse
   consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal
   stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences
   pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid
   concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any
   species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by
   female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator
   during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed
   females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than
   controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected
   physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared
   the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their
   control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or
   unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with
   corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with
   smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs.
   Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival.
   Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by
   increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study
   identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby
   maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to
   biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link
   environmental conditions to population productivity and viability.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the effects of nutrient availability, UV radiation

   mycobiota. Two sites at Edmonson Point were studied: the first was poor
   in nutrients, near the glacier, and the second was close to bird nesting
   sites. The highest abundance of soil fungi was recorded at the site
   adjacent to the bird nesting sites. Phoma herbarum was the most abundant
   taxon. Lecytophora lignicola and Ascotricha erinacea are new records for
   continental Antarctica. The fungal assemblage from the
   nutrient-deficient site was characterized by a dominance-diversity curve
   approaching the broken-stick model, the assemblage from the soil
   influenced by birds was characterized by a lognormal distribution.
   Plastic cloches were used in experiments designed to assess differences
   in fungal assemblages subjected to altered temperature and/or UV
   exposure. Dominance-diversity curves and diversity values of soil fungal
   mycobiota were compared in their natural condition as compared with
   manipulated conditions. Under the walled cloches, at both sites,
   artificial warming led to stress on Antarctic soil fungal assemblages.
   In contrast, UV protection led to a higher equilibrium in the assemblage
   structure. On the basis of the results obtained, it could be proposed
   that UV radiation is the most important limiting ecological factor for
   soil mycobiota in continental Antarctica.},

Abstract = {When used in genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops,
   glyphosate provides great flexibility to manipulate weed populations
   with consequences for invertebrates and higher trophic levels, for
   example birds. A range of timings of band and overall spray treatments
   of glyphosate to GMHT sugar beet were compared with a conventional weed
   control programme in four field trials over 2 years. Single overall
   sprays applied between 200 and 250 accumulated day degrees (above a base
   air temperature of 3degreesC; degreesCd) and band applied treatments
   applied at 10\% or 20\% ground cover within the crop rows generally gave
   significantly greater weed biomass and seed rain than conventional
   treatments, while later band sprays (more than 650degreesCd) reduced
   seed return. Two overall sprays of glyphosate produced low weed biomass
   and generally lowest seed return of all treatments but tended to give
   some of the highest yields. However, the early overall sprays
   (200-250degreesCd) and band sprays gave as good or better yields than
   the conventional and were generally equivalent to the two overall-spray
   programme. Viable seeds in the soil after the experiment were generally
   higher following the early overall (200-250degreesCd) and the band spray
   treatments than following the conventional. The results show that
   altered management of GMHT sugar beet can provide alternative scenarios
   to those of the recent Farm Scale Evaluation trials. Without yield loss
   they can enhance weed seed banks and autumn bird food availability
   compared with conventional management, or provide early season benefits
   to invertebrates and nesting birds, depending on the system chosen.
   Conventional weed control does not have the flexibility to enable these
   scenarios that benefit both agriculture and environment, although there
   may be some options for increasing weed seed return in autumn.},

Abstract = {Adjustment of offspring sex ratios should be favoured by natural
   selection when parents are capable of facultatively altering brood sex
   ratios and of recognizing the circumstances that predict the probable
   fitness benefit of producing sons and daughters. Although experimental
   studies have shown that female birds may adjust offspring sex ratios in
   response to changes in their own condition and in the external
   appearance of their mate, and male attributes other than his external
   morphology are also thought to act as signals of male quality, it is not
   known whether females will respond to changes in such signals, in the
   absence of any change in the appearance of the male himself. Here, we
   experimentally manipulated a male courtship display, the green plants
   carried to the nest by male spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor),
   without changing any physical attributes of the male himself, and
   examined whether this influenced female decisions on offspring sex
   ratio. We found that in an environment in which female starlings were
   producing more daughters than sons, experimental enhancement of the
   green nesting material caused females to significantly increase the
   number of male eggs produced and thereby removed the female bias. This
   effect was consistent in 2 years and at two localities. This
   demonstrates that the green material, whose function has long puzzled
   biologists, conveys important information to the female and that she
   facultatively adjusts offspring production accordingly.},

Abstract = {In most communities, a considerable number of the Constituent species
   will only occupy a small percentage of sites or habitat patches.
   However, the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of rare
   species are seldom examined and are poorly understood. I tested several
   explanations of landscape-scale rarity in the New England cobble beach
   plant community, an assemblage of halophytic forbs associated with
   fringing beds of the marine intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora.
   Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the cobble Substrate,
   thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species.
   Frequencies of the presence of forb species behind 387 sampled Spartina
   beds distributed along 120 km of shoreline in Narragansett Bay, Rhode
   Island, USA. ranged from 0.005 to 0.382. Both the whole forb assemblage
   and individual species were strongly nested with respect to patch size
   and species richness. Species that were rare oil a landscape scale were
   generally only found behind the longest beds. and bed length was
   positively related to species diversity. Experimental seed additions to
   40 beds ranging in length from 8 to 688 m indicated that
   intermediate-sized beds often occupied by common species are not
   habitable by three rare forbs. When present behind the longest beds,
   these rare species are always associated with a microhabitat
   characterized by a relatively fine-grained and highly stable Substrate.
   A series of Substrate manipulations combined with experimental seed
   additions indicated that the rare annuals Spergularia marina, Salicornia
   biglovii, and Atriplex arenaria are restricted to the longest Spartina
   beds because smaller beds lack suitable substrate. These experiments
   also. Suggest that seed supply. competitors, and herbivores are not the
   proximate causes of the absence of these species from smaller beds.
   although dispersal limitation may prevent the colonization of many
   larger habitable patches. The microhabitat required by the rare forbs
   appears to be generated by the deposition of fine-grained particles
   behind the center of the longest Spartina beds. Consequently. bed length
   is causally related to the distribution of populations at a landscape
   scale and to species richness and composition at the scale of a whole
   habitat patch.},

   the island of Corsica (Parus caeruleus ogliastrae ) adorn their nests
   with fragments of aromatic plants. These plants have chemical compounds
   that are used by humans to make aromatic house cleaners and herbal
   medicines. We also show that individual blue tits maintain an aromatic
   nest environment when offspring are raised, using odour cues to
   determine the frequency with which they replenish the nest with fresh
   plant material. We provide an exceptional example of the ecologically
   relevant use of olfaction by birds under natural conditions. To our
   knowledge, we present the first experimental demonstration that a
   free-ranging animal makes use of smell to maintain an aromatic
   environment for offspring with plants, supporting predictions of the
   nest protection hypothesis.},

Title = {Salt marsh canopy architecture differs with the number and composition

Abstract = {In response to the debate about how ecosystem functions are affected by
   species richness vs. species composition, we explored canopy
   architecture (plant cover, height, and layering) in three contexts: a
   reference marsh, a field experiment, and a greenhouse experiment.
   Species-rich canopies (five or more species) in the reference marsh were
   taller and had more ( 13 vs. 7) layers than monotypes of Salicornia
   virginica, although both had 100\% cover. Cover and layering were
   greater for three- and six-species plots, than for one-species plots in
   both the field experiment (70 2 X 2 m plots, eight herbaceous
   halophytes) and greenhouse (,same treatments). Cover (80-95\%) and
   heights were similar among field experimental treatments after two
   growing seasons (18 mo after planting seedlings in April 1997). In years
   3-4, heights (similar to0.5 m) and cover (similar to100\%) were similar
   to those of the 1998 reference marsh data. but only 1-3 canopy layers
   had developed. Species effects became evident when assemblages were
   replicated in the greenhouse. The eight one-species treatments differed
   in cover. height. and layering, and complementary traits produced more
   layers in multispecies canopies than monotypes. Within the three- and
   six-specie, canopies, attribute were similar for most assemblages. but
   there was a slight height effect with S. virginica, as in the field. In
   general, the effects of individual species were best distinguished by
   heights, and species-richness effects by layering. Of relevance to the
   larger diversity debate is our finding that the attribute examined
   influenced perceptions of the importance of species number vs. species
   composition.
   To apply our results, manager,, would assess height and layering, not
   just vegetation cover. Salt marsh restorationists would establish
   species-rich assemblages in newly graded sites to accelerate the
   development of canopy height and layering. Monitoring efforts would
   continue until canopy architecture matches that of reference system (>4
   yr for Californian marshes planted oil coarse, nutrient-poor soils).
   Finally, research on wildlife habitat quality (e.g., nesting potential
   for the endangered Belding's Savannah Sparrow {[}Passerculus
   sandwichensis beldingi]) would determine critical levels of canopy
   layering and height for nesting, feeding, and perching to defend
   territories.},

Title = {Neonatology of reptiles},
Journal = {HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {353-370},
Abstract = {Neonatal reptiles are here defined as an age class of young eureptilian
   amniotes (excluding birds) that express attributes most influenced by
   the pre-paritive development environment (oviduct, egg, and egg nest)
   and by the demands of parition and first dispersal. Neonatal character
   states are typically transformed, reduced, or eliminated during the
   first 10\% of their prereproductive development. Traditionally, neonates
   have not been distinguished from juvenile reptiles. As a result the
   neonatology of reptiles has rarely been addressed in past literature.
   Recent studies reveal a complex array of developmental scenarios
   involving character state transformations, heterochrony, unique
   character states in morphology, behavior, physiology, nutrition,
   dispersion and health. Unique morphological features (such as egg teeth)
   and limited skeletal ossification characterize many neonates.
   Distinguishing behaviors include ``reversal{''} movements, utilization
   of bright color patterns, and startling movements with both serving as
   anti-predation mechanisms. Prolonged association with protective
   parents, group migration, unique agonistic behavior, and tendencies
   toward rapid dispersion characterize the neonates of individual species.
   Neonatal physiological attributes include: a special availability to
   inoculation by symbiont fermenting anaerobes in herbivores, rapid
   conforming responses to their external environments in thermal and
   hydric exchanges, and in the case of some turtles, extraordinary
   capacities for supercooling (8.9 C). Post-paritive lecithotrophy
   (nutrition from residual yolk) sustain both the ovenwintering of
   nestlings and the dispersion of nonfeeding young for as long as several
   months. Resistance to infections (such as mycoplasmas) from their
   maternal parents,combine with nutritive reserves of residual yolk and a
   common tendency for rapid dispersion to make neonates attractive
   candidates for augmentation and translocation programs. Coupled with the
   practical advantages of maintaining and manipulating small animals in a
   laboratory environment, these qualities distinguish neonates as
   particularly useful models for experimentally evaluating the relative
   apportionment of reproductive resources into greater numbers of
   offspring or into improved quality/survivorship of individual offspring.},

Abstract = {The peak load reduction hypothesis suggests that hatching asynchrony in

   used the doubly labeled water technique to measure the energy
   expenditure of green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) that reared
   experimentally manipulated synchronous and asynchronous broods. Peak
   metabolic rates of the two experimental groups did not differ, but
   parents of asynchronous broods metabolized significantly less energy
   than did parents of synchronous broods throughout the first half of the
   brood-rearing period. Our results suggest that hatching asynchrony in
   parrotlets substantially shortens the temporal duration of high brood
   energy demand, but does not reduce the magnitude of peak energy demand.},

Pages = {131-154},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A number of hypotheses for hatching asynchrony suggest that the size
   hierarchy among nestlings produced by hatching asynchrony is adaptive
   and confers benefits to parents. We assessed the costs and benefits of
   asynchronous hatching in the Greenrumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus),
   a small Neotropical parrot that hatches large clutches very
   asynchronously. We manipulated eggs to create broods of four, six, or
   eight young that hatched synchronously or asynchronously. In a second
   experiment, we tested whether food limits offspring survival by
   experimentally feeding later hatched young in large asynchronous broods.
   We also examined the premise that food varies unpredictably by sampling
   seeds throughout several breeding seasons.
   Experimentally synchronized broods generally fledged as many or more
   young than asynchronous broods. Synchrony particularly outperformed
   asynchrony in broods of eight, where food demands should have been
   greatest. Nestlings had a higher probability of hedging from synchronous
   broods than from asynchronous broods, from small rather than medium or
   large broods, and if they were early hatched rather than later hatched.
   Most mortality in asynchronous broods occurred within 12 d of hatching,
   and a significantly greater proportion of later hatched chicks died with
   empty crops than did early hatched chicks. Later hatched chicks grew
   more slowly than their earlier hatched nestmates, but at fledging they
   were as heavy or heavier than earlier hatched chicks. Chicks from
   asynchronous broods were slightly heavier at hedging than synchronous
   chicks, but there was no correlation between hedging mass and the
   likelihood of being resighted in subsequent years. Cormack-Jolly-Seber
   model estimates revealed no significant differences in annual survival
   rates between young fledged from synchronous and asynchronous broods.
   Female chicks hedged from synchronous broods were recruited into the
   study population at a lower rate than those from asynchronous broods.
   Older chicks from reduced broods were less likely to hedge than chicks
   from broods that fledged all their young. Parents of large synchronous
   and asynchronous broods provisioned their young at similar rates and did
   not differ significantly in their subsequent survival. Females that
   raised experimentally synchronous and asynchronous broods showed no
   significant differences in the likelihood, timing, or success of their
   next breeding attempt. A marginally higher proportion of last-hatched
   chicks that received supplemental food survived to fledging than
   last-hatched control chicks, but feeding had no effect on penultimate
   chicks. Seed densities showed a high degree of autocorrelation over
   spans of 30-50 d. Asynchronous hatching appears to result in the
   mortality of the smallest young, due in part to the inequitable
   distribution of food among nestmates, rather than to food limitation,
   and as a direct result of the size disparities among nestmates. Thus,
   parrotlet parents appeared to derive no detectable short- or long-term
   benefits from the staggered hatching of their young through increased
   nestling growth and survival, reduced parental efforts, or increased
   parental survival. Although other adaptive benefits from hatching
   asynchrony are possible that were not tested directly in these
   experiments (e.g., `'insurance'' that some nestlings will survive), they
   seem insufficient to account for the extreme hatching asynchrony
   observed in the parrotlet. Instead, benefits to egg survival derived
   from the early onset of incubation may offset the costs of asynchronous
   hatching.},

Abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetries are small, random developmental accidents in
   morphological traits that would otherwise be described as being
   bilaterally symmetric. Experimental evidence indicates that in mate
   choice situations individuals possessing symmetric arbitrary traits or
   symmetric secondary sexual characters are preferred over those with
   larger asymmetries. This experiment investigated the effect of symmetric
   and asymmetric arbitrary traits (arrangements of coloured leg-bands) on
   reproductive success in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Six
   groups of six males and six females were separated into six free-flight
   breeding aviaries. Nestboxes and nesting material were freely available
   throughout the experiment. Males wore symmetric and asymmetric
   arrangements of the same coloured leg-bands. Each male wore two orange
   and two light green bands, two on each leg. There were six possible
   arrangements of these leg-bands. One male from each of these six
   leg-band treatments was present in each aviary, along with six females
   wearing numbered orange bands. Symmetrically banded males produced more
   offspring that survived past the period of parental care than males in
   either of the asymmetric treatments; this appeared to be the effect of
   female choice processes and female-based parental investment and not
   male intra-sexual dominance. This is the first experiment to indicate
   that symmetrically manipulated males gain reproductive advantages in
   controlled laboratory conditions and further supports recent theories
   indicating the evolutionary importance of symmetry in signalling-trait

   Implications for mitigating nest depredation in farmlands},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {829},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Predation is a major evolutionary force in animal ecology. Mechanisms by
   which prey coloration provides camouflage has been widely studied.
   However, predator response to prey camouflage and concealment has
   received less attention. Understanding vegetation structure effect on
   depredation success could help managers design strategies to mitigate
   the depredation of managed species (e.g., threatened or hunted). We
   aimed to investigate the relationship between depredation rate, nest
   camouflage and concealment in ground-nesting birds of farmlands, and
   their predators. We set up an experiment of 2576 artificial ground nests
   to assess the role of egg coloration (white, light green, and dark
   green), egg size (small, medium, and large), and vegetation structure
   (vegetation height and land use) in nest survival rates. We also
   explored the role of predator searching strategies by analysing clumped
   depredation and multiple depredation events. Of the nests, 34.0\% were
   depredated, with corvids as the predators 78.5\% of the time. Corvid
   depredation decreased by 40-60\% in grasslands and spring crops above a
   vegetation height of 30 cm. In contrast, vegetation height and land use
   may be of far less importance in avoiding depredation by other
   predators. The probability of depredation was spatially clumped,
   suggesting that predators increase search effort in areas where a nest
   was previously encountered. Neighboring depredation and depredation
   repetition were more frequent in corvids than in other predators. Our
   study indicates that nests in vegetation higher than 30 cm had a drastic
   reduction in depredation rates by corvids. Management of vegetation
   structure is a key tool to mitigate depredation risk, and improving the
   availability of alternative food resources may be a complementary tool.},

Title = {Nutrition of free-living Neotropical psittacine nestlings and
   implications for hand-feeding formulas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION},
Abstract = {Psittacidae is one of the most endangered families of birds in the
   world. Knowledge of their nutrition is important for understanding their
   survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate
   husbandry under human care. Hand-rearing is a common practice for
   psittacines, however research on their nutrition is limited. We analysed
   the predicted metabolisable energy, crude protein, crude fat, minerals
   and the essential amino acid profiles of the crop contents from
   free-living nestlings of scarlet macaws (Ara macao) and red-and-green
   macaws (Ara chloropterus) from southeastern Peru, Cuban Amazons (Amazona
   leucocephala bahamensis) from the Bahamas, lilac-crowned Amazons
   (Amazona finschi) from northwestern Mexico and thick-billed parrots
   (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) from northern Mexico. The crop content of
   the different parrot species displayed remarkably similar nutritional
   profiles, considering their diversity in habitats, geographic ranges and
   food sources. The crude protein and crude fat concentrations in crop
   samples were particularly similar for the Ara and Amazona species, while
   the thick-billed parrot stood out for its higher crude fat and lower
   crude protein content. Wider variations were found among the
   concentrations of sodium (Na) and iron (Fe), proline and tryptophan.
   Compared with the requirements of 6-12 weeks leghorn chickens, all
   free-ranging parrot diets contained lower crude protein, calcium (Ca),
   potassium (P) and Na concentrations. The hand-feeding formulas contained
   lower crude fat, magnesium (Mg), arginine, valine and phenylalanine
   concentrations, as well as much higher levels of Ca and zinc (Zn), in
   comparison with parrot crop samples. Our data suggest that a single
   formulation could be used to hand-rear Ara and Amazona sp. of 3 weeks of
   age and older, while a different formulation would likely be more
   appropriated for Rhynchopsitta sp. Experimental studies should evaluate
   if increasing the concentration of crude fat, Mg, arginine, valine and
   phenylalanine enhances psittacine chick growth and health.},

Abstract = {Quantitative food web analyses can provide insights into the specificity
   of consumers such as herbivores, parasites and parasitoids.
   Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential
   benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for
   introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis
   downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is
   invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial
   mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental
   food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to
   test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi
   specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird
   nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird
   nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to
   assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of
   host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction
   strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within
   the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only
   Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of
   specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura
   annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of
   the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and
   preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species.
   Although there was some significant preference for particular bird
   species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove
   specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our
   results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C.
   annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce
   few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress
   populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental
   risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation
   on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.},

Title = {Increased abundance and productivity of a grassland bird after
   experimental control of invasive tall fescue},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) is a widespread invasive grass in
   the United States that degrades habitat quality for biodiversity.
   Herbicide followed by seeding of native plants reduces tall fescue and
   is predicted to restore habitat quality over time, but little is known
   about short-term (1-2 year) impacts on native species. We conducted a
   landscape-scale controlled experiment to assess the short-term effects
   of herbicide and seeding on the reproduction of an obligate grassland
   bird, the dickcissel (Spiza americana). In 2014, four sites in southern
   Iowa were each subdivided into three patches (mean 7 ha). One patch in
   each site was treated with glyphosate herbicide (spray-only), one with
   herbicide and native seeding (spray-and-seed), with the third serving as
   a control. Two sites were grazed by cattle from April to July and two
   sites were ungrazed. We monitored dickcissel reproduction in 2016,
   finding that they were more abundant, built more nests, experienced less
   cowbird parasitism, had increased nest survival, and produced more
   fledglings on spray-only and spray-and-seed treatments compared to
   control patches. Dickcissels nested infrequently on grazed
   sites-especially grazed control patches. We did not detect any impacts
   on clutch size, provisioning rates, or nestling mass, but Araneae
   (spiders) and Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars) may have been smaller on
   sprayed patches. Positive responses by dickcissels were likely due to
   successful reduction of tall fescue and improved access to suitable nest
   sites through increased vegetation heterogeneity. Our results indicate
   that using herbicide and seeding to restore tall fescue-dominated sites
   improves habitat quality for this grassland bird, shortly after
   restoration.},

Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {219},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The length of time an herbicide remains in soils can be used as an
   indicator for diffuse pollution assessment. Atrazine, a residual
   herbicide with a wide range of reported environmental impacts, has been
   extensively applied in agricultural soils cultivated with gramineous
   crops. While atrazine persistence in soils has been widely studied by
   quantifying half-life from experimental dissipation curves, the spatial
   variability of half-life at the landscape scale has not been
   sufficiently explored. The objectives of this work were to estimate
   atrazine dissipation in a variety of soils and to map its spatial
   variability by modelling half-life as a function of environmental
   variables. Based on laboratory determination and environmental data,
   atrazine dissipation in soils was mapped across the territory of Cordoba
   province, central Argentina. First, we determined the dissipation
   parameters of atrazine under a variety of environmental conditions in 60
   sites. Second, we fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model for the estimated
   atrazine half-lives, considering a soil site-specific property (soil
   organic carbon, SOC) and land use (gramineous crop, non-gramineous crop,
   pasture, and forest) as covariates. We used Integrated Nested Laplace
   Approximation and stochastic partial differential equations to model the
   spatial dependence on random effects. The results suggest that atrazine
   half-life can be spatially predicted by SOC and land use. Atrazine
   dissipation was faster in sites with previous gramineous crops and high
   soil organic matter. The digital map allowed us to quantify the
   environmental variability of atrazine dissipation in Cordoba (3.2-99.5
   days). The modelling strategy might be applied to other herbicide
   compounds by selecting proper environmental covariates.},

Title = {Cattle grazing in CRP grasslands during the nesting season: effects on
   avian abundance and diversity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a primary tool for restoring
   grassland in the United States, in part as wildlife habitat, which has
   benefited declining grassland bird populations. Among potential
   mid-contract management practices used to maintain early-successional
   CRP grasslands, cattle grazing had been prohibited and is currently
   disincentivized during the primary nesting season for birds (much of the
   growing season), despite the important role that large herbivores
   historically played in structuring grassland ecosystems. Conservative
   grazing of CRP grasslands could increase spatial heterogeneity in
   vegetation structure and plant diversity, potentially supporting higher
   densities of some grassland bird species and higher bird diversity. Our
   objective was to determine the effect of experimental cattle grazing on
   species-specific relative abundance and occupancy, species diversity,
   and community dissimilarity of grassland birds on CRP grasslands across
   the longitudinal extent of Kansas, USA (a 63.5-cm precipitation
   gradient) during the 2017-2019 avian breeding seasons. Fifty-three of
   108 fields were grazed by cattle during the growing seasons of 2017 and
   2018 and all fields were rested from grazing in 2019. For all analyses,
   we examined separate model sets for semiarid western versus more mesic
   eastern Kansas. Using data from line transect surveys, we modeled
   relative abundances of 5 songbird species: grasshopper sparrow
   (Ammodramus savannarum), dickcissel (Spiza americana), eastern
   meadowlark (Sturnella magna), western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta),
   and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Grazing had delayed yet
   positive effects on abundances of grasshopper sparrow in western Kansas,
   and eastern meadowlark in eastern Kansas, but negative effects on
   dickcissel abundance in western Kansas and especially on burned fields
   in eastern Kansas. Somewhat counterintuitively, brown-headed cowbirds in
   western Kansas were more abundant on ungrazed versus grazed fields in
   the years after grazing began. In addition, we modeled multi-season
   occupancy of 3 gamebird species (ring-necked pheasant {[}Phasianus
   colcicus], northern bobwhite {[}Colinus virginianus], mourning dove
   {[}Zenaida macroura]) and Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii);
   grazing did not affect occupancy of these species. In eastern Kansas,
   species diversity was highest in grazed, unburned fields. In western
   Kansas, bird communities in grazed and ungrazed fields were dissimilar,
   as determined from multivariate analysis. Though regionally variable,
   conservative stocking of cattle on CRP grasslands during the nesting
   season as a mid-contract management tool might increase bird species
   diversity by restructuring habitat that accommodates a greater variety
   of species and decreasing abundances of species associated with taller,
   denser stands of vegetation.},

Title = {Analysis of Egg Variation and Foreign Egg Rejection in Ruppell's Weaver
   (Ploceus galbula)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Egg appearance is notable for its variation and as a source of
   recognition cues in bird species that are subject to egg-mimicking brood
   parasitism. Here I analyze the egg appearance of an East African
   weaverbird species that has variable eggs and is a host of brood
   parasitism by an egg-mimicking cuckoo, in order to (1) compare
   population variation to variation within a clutch as a measure of the
   distinctiveness of eggs; (2) assess modularity versus correlation among
   egg appearance traits as an indication of the complexity of egg
   signatures; and (3) address whether the eggs are discretely polymorphic
   or continuously variable in appearance. I also compare three methods of
   assessing egg coloration: reduction of spectral data to orthogonal
   components, targeted spectral shape variables, and avian visual
   modeling. Then I report the results of egg replacement experiments that
   assess the relationship between egg rejection behavior and the
   difference in appearance between own and foreign eggs. Ruppell's weaver
   (Ploceus galbula) eggs are variable in appearance between individuals
   and consistent within a clutch, but vary widely in the distinctiveness
   of particular traits. Most aspects of color and spotting are decoupled
   from each other, including coloration likely to derive from different
   pigments. Egg ground color is bimodal, with a broad continuous class of
   off-white/UV eggs and another broad class of blue-green eggs. Variation
   in all other traits is unimodal and usually normal in distribution.
   Females reject foreign eggs on the basis of the difference in brightness
   of the ground color and spotting of foreign eggs relative to their own,
   and the difference in degree to which spots are aggregated at the broad
   end of the egg. This aggregation is among the most distinctive features
   of their eggs, but the brightness of the ground color and spotting
   brightness are not; the birds' use of brightness rather than the more
   distinctive chromatic variation to recognize eggs might reflect the
   salience of achromatic contrast in a dim enclosed nest.},

Title = {Color of Artificial Light at Night Affects Incubation Behavior in the
   Great Tit, Parus major},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) has been recognized as a biodiversity
   threat due to the drastic effects it can have on many organisms. In wild
   birds, artificial illumination alters many natural behaviors that are
   important for fitness, including chick provisioning. Although incubation
   is a key determinant of the early developmental environment, studies
   into the effects of ALAN on bird incubation behavior are lacking. We
   measured nest temperature in nest boxes of great tits during the
   incubation period in two consecutive years. Nest boxes were located in
   eight previously dark field sites that have been experimentally
   illuminated since 2012 with white, green, or red light, or were left
   dark. We tested if light treatment affected mean nest temperature,
   number of times birds leave the nest (off-bout frequency), and off-bout
   duration during the incubation period. Subsequently, we investigated if
   incubation behavior is related to fitness. We found that birds
   incubating in the white light during a cold, early spring had lower mean
   nest temperatures at the end of incubation, both during the day and
   during the night, compared to birds in the green light. Moreover, birds
   incubating in white light took fewer off-bouts, but off-bouts were on
   average longer. The opposite was true for birds breeding in the green
   light. Low incubation temperatures and few but long off-bouts can have
   severe consequences for developing embryos. In our study, eggs from
   birds that took on average few off-bouts needed more incubation days to
   hatch compared to eggs from birds that took many off-bouts.
   Nevertheless, we found no clear fitness effects of light treatment or
   incubation behavior on the number of hatchlings or hatchling weight. Our
   results add to the growing body of literature that shows that effects of
   ALAN can be subtle, can differ due to the spectral composition of light,
   and can be year-dependent. These subtle alterations of natural behaviors
   might not have severe fitness consequences in the short-term. However,
   in the long term they could add up, negatively affecting parent
   condition and survival as well as offspring recruitment, especially in
   urban environments where more environmental pollutants are present.</p>},

Abstract = {Surveys on detritivorous moths were carried out at three locations in
   Kyushu, Japan, in 2019, using bait traps. The trap material consisted of
   dead leaves or rice straw, baited with dog food, chicken manure, or bat
   guano. A total of 293 moth individuals, comprising 25 species belonging
   to 17 families, were trapped during the experiment. The emerged moths
   included 285 detritivore individuals of 17 species in nine families and
   eight herbivore individuals of eight different families. Most moth
   individuals emerged from the traps made of dead leaves with dog food,
   which contains several nutrients, as the bait. Of these individuals,
   species such as Phaeoses sp. (Tineidae) and Pyralis
   farinalis(Pyralidae), which often emerge from bird nests but are
   difficult to collect, were also found. This is the first study to
   collect detritivorous moths using traps with different baits. (c) 2021

Journal = {AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Monitoring population trends for bird species in the Arctic and
   sub-Arctic can be difficult and cost prohibitive. Breeding populations
   of birds in these remote locations may be changing and have garnered
   much attention regarding their conservation. We analyzed data from bird
   lists (daily species observations) collected while conducting other
   targeted research to estimate trends in the probability of observing
   species at two sub-Arctic study sites. For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52
   species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95\%
   credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends
   with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species)
   we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence
   and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60\% of
   species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three
   larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional,
   provincial and national. We hypothesized that trends may be due to
   climate change effects or because of effects related to intensive
   herbivory from nesting geese. Trends for most of the species where we
   made specific predictions from these hypotheses agreed with those
   predicted; however, well-designed experiments are needed to conclusively
   determine the driving mechanisms of these trends. Collecting bird list
   data while simultaneously conducting other research is not nearly as
   time consuming or expensive as targeted breeding bird surveys (e.g.,
   point counts, call counts, nest searching, etc.). This analysis method
   may be of utility for other remote field study sites where gaps in trend
   data exist.},

Abstract = {Within the environmental risk assessment conducted for pesticide
   registration in the European Union (EU), avian reproductive toxicity is
   characterized after exposing adults. However, eggs of ground-nesting
   species can be exposed when pesticide applications occur during laying
   or incubation. We simulated environmentally realistic exposure of
   red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) eggs to an herbicide (2,4-D) and a
   fungicide (tebuconazole) applied to winter cereal crops during the
   breeding season of most farmland birds. We analyzed the effects on
   hatching success, offspring survival, and physiology. Exposure by
   overspray led to greater pesticide accumulation in the eggshell or
   content than exposure through contact with treated soil (3.1-13.7 times
   higher, depending on the pesticide and target sample). Egg overspray
   with tebuconazole significantly increased chick mortality, which was
   26\% higher than that of controls. 2,4-D caused a similar but a close to
   significant increase (chick mortality 24\% higher than controls).
   Exposure to either pesticide through contact with treated soils did not
   affect chick survival but altered some biochemical parameters
   posthatching. Our experiment shows that egg spraying with pesticides
   should be considered as a relevant exposure scenario in risk assessment
   procedures, given its potential to affect the reproductive success of
   ground-nesting farmland birds.},

Title = {Hoopoe Upupa epops male feeding effort is related to female cosmetic egg
   colouration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {51},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Avian eggshell colouration might function as a post-mating sexually
   selected signal of female quality, influencing male parental investment
   and, hence, reproductive success. This hypothesis has been tested for
   intrinsic eggshell pigments as biliverdin (blue-green colouration)
   and/or protoporphyrin (brown coloured spots), but never for colourations
   applied post-laying. Post-laying staining colouration due to, for
   instance, uropygial secretion of the female could reflect its phenotypic
   properties and, thus, might be a cue for male investment in
   reproduction. In hoopoes, the uropygial gland of incubating females
   hosts symbiotic bacteria that are responsible for the brown colour of
   their uropygial secretion and of the eggshells, as they cover their
   bluish-grey eggshells with gland secretion after laying. The secretion
   protects embryos from pathogenic trans-shell infections and, thus, egg
   colouration may function as a cue or even as a post-mating sexually
   selected signal of antimicrobial potential in hoopoes. In a wild hoopoe
   population breeding in nest boxes in Spain, we test this hypothesis by
   exploring whether egg colour predicts male parental investment. In
   accordance with the hypothesis, we found that the amount of food
   provided by males to incubating females was higher in nests with less
   saturated eggshell colours. This relationship was affected by female
   body condition. High quality females in terms of body condition and/or
   in secretion colour obtained better males in terms of provisioning
   effort during incubation. Given that eggshell saturation is negatively
   related to density of bacterial symbionts in uropygial secretions, one
   possibility is that males may regulate their parental investment in
   accordance to the expected characteristics of mutualistic bacteria
   hosted in uropygial glands and deposited on eggshells. We discuss
   alternative explanations for our results, concluding that the
   post-mating sexual selection hypothesis is the most likely but
   experimental modification of egg colour is needed to test it further.},

Abstract = {Following large crude oil spills, oil from feathers of brooding birds
   and oiled nesting material can transfer to eggs, resulting in reduced

   sublethal application of weathered Deepwater Horizon crude oil to the
   eggshell surface alters heart rate and metabolic rate in Zebra Finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata) embryos. We first determined sublethal
   applications with a dosing experiment. Embryo viability for eggs exposed
   to 5 mu L or more of crude oil decreased significantly. We conducted a
   second experiment to measure heart rate and metabolic rate
   (CO(2)production) 5 and 9 d after 1 sublethal application of crude oil
   to eggshells on day 3 of incubation. One application of 1.0 or 2.5 mu L
   of crude oil reduced embryonic heart rate and metabolic rate on day 12
   of incubation. Using unfertilized eggs, we measured the transfer of
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the eggshell surface to egg
   contents 9 d after a single application of sublethal crude oil. Our

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Hole-nesting tits Parus spp. have been classified as ``unsuitable{''}
   hosts for cuckoo parasitism because cuckoos cannot enter a cavity if the
   entrance is too small. However, Chinese tits could reject alien eggs and
   egg ejection rate increased with the local diversity of parasitic cuckoo
   species. Antiparasitic behavior among Chinese tits may have evolved due
   to greater size variation among sympatric cuckoo species. This raises
   the question of whether differently sized parasitic cuckoos pose
   different threats to Chinese tits. A green-backed tit Parus monticolus
   population that is sympatric with Asian emerald cuckoo Chrysococcyx
   maculatus (eme-cuckoo, small-sized parasite) and common cuckoo Cuculus
   canorus (com-cuckoo, large-sized parasite), and a cinereous tit P.
   cinereus population that is only sympatric with com-cuckoo were chosen
   as study organisms. We observed behavioral response and recorded alarm
   calls of the 2 tit species to eme-cuckoo, com-cuckoo, chipmunk Tamias
   sibiricus (a nest predator) and dove Streptopelia orientalis (a harmless
   control), and subsequently played back alarm calls to conspecific
   incubating females. In dummy experiments, both tit species performed
   intense response behavior to chipmunk, but rarely responded strongly to
   the 3 avian species. In playback experiments, both tit species responded
   strongly to conspecific chipmunk alarm calls, but rarely responded to
   dove alarm calls. The intensity of response of incubating female
   green-backed tits to eme-cuckoo and com-cuckoo alarm calls were similar
   to that of chipmunk alarm calls, while the intensity to eme-cuckoo alarm
   calls was higher than the intensity to dove alarm calls which was
   similar to that of com-cuckoo alarm calls. In contrast, few female
   cinereous tits responded to eme-cuckoo and com-cuckoo alarm calls. These
   findings indicated that the threat level of eme-cuckoo was slightly
   greater than that of com-cuckoo for sympatric green-backed tits, but not
   for allopatric cinereous tits.},

Title = {Land-sharing vs. land-sparing urban development modulate predator-prey
   interactions in Europe},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban areas are expanding globally as a consequence of human population
   increases, with overall negative effects on biodiversity. To prevent the
   further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms
   behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to
   preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban
   development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous
   green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small,
   fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent
   focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in
   this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the
   observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to
   explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator-prey
   interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from
   nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two
   extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and
   whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of
   ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554)
   was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest
   survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and
   corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance
   of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing
   urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the
   pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that
   predator-prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban
   development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher
   proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a
   limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the
   provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve
   conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide
   information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of
   urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over
   land-sharing urban development.},

   (RF-EMFs) from mobile telephony has rapidly increased in the last two
   decades and this trend is expected to continue. The effects of this
   exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in
   a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be
   scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new
   and control-impact radiation treatment is used.
   In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify
   indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony
   frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a
   plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base
   transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant
   community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed
   community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type.
   We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for
   a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical
   theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on
   plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for
   the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact
   experiment.
   The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups:
   (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the
   field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the
   populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians
   (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other
   organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or
   population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height,
   vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing
   phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the
   field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed
   viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers
   seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month
   of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the
   proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress
   tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of
   ``non-plant{''} indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower
   visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests
   over ground. To detect ecological responses that occur for the first
   year since a herbaceous community has been exposed to potentially
   bioactive RF-EMF, the first two indicators groups should be used.},

Title = {When an enemy of an enemy is not a friend: Tri-trophic interactions
   between kaka, puriri moths and makomako trees},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Predators can indirectly structure local plant communities by altering
   the diversity and behaviour of herbivores. These `trophic cascades' can
   be seriously disrupted by the local extinction of top predators. They
   can also be restored by the subsequent re-introduction of top predators
   by conservationists. Here, we investigated trophic cascades involving
   kaka, puriri moths and their host trees. New Zealand kaka (Nestor
   meridionalis, Nestoridae) are large parrots that were extirpated from
   most of its range in the 20th century. Unlike most other parrots, kaka
   forage primarily by digging through the vascular cambium of trees in
   search of wood-boring insects. They regularly consume puriri moths
   (Aenetus virescens, Hepialidae), a giant species of ghost moth whose
   larvae tunnel into the heartwood of trees for protection. Puriri moths
   are host specific and frequently attack makomako (Aristotelia serrata,
   Elaeocarpaceae), a sub-canopy tree species. We conducted a field
   experiment in Zealandia, a nature reserve to which kaka were
   reintroduced over a decade ago, to test the hypothesis that kaka would
   increase tree fitness by removing larval parasites (i.e. herbivores).
   Contrary to our expectations, results revealed an additive, negative
   effect of both the predator (kaka) and parasite (puriri moths) on plant
   fitness. Therefore, the tri-trophic interactions restored by the
   reintroduction of kaka into Zealandia appear to be unique, as the
   actions of the predator decreased fruit and flower production, rather
   than increasing plant fitness, as typically reported for trophic
   cascades.},

Title = {Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus laying smaller eggs after a decline in
   snail numbers: an indirect effect of slug control in a city park},
Journal = {ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Egg size is a basic species-specific life-history trait in birds which
   influences offspring performance through the nestling stage and,
   therefore, fitness. Shells of snails are the principal source of calcium
   for female parids and some other passerines during egg formation.
   Shortages in the availability of snail shells may lead to laying smaller
   eggs with thinner shells. In urban green spaces that require protection
   against pests, the numbers of snails may become greatly reduced in
   response to mollusdcide treatments. The use of a molluscicide treatment
   against pest slugs in the Botanic Garden, Lodz, Poland, in 2013 and 2014
   provided a unique quasi-experimental setting to study the effect of
   molluscidde on both non-target snails and Blue lit Cyanistes caeruleus
   eggs. Using a forest study site where no treatment was applied as a
   control area, we tested for effects of the molluscicide treatment in the
   Botanic Garden on the density of snails and on the egg volume of Blue
   Tits. We found that after the molluscicide treatment a dramatic drop in
   snail numbers occurred, which likely restricted the availability of
   snail shells for egg laying Blue Tits in the Botanic Garden.
   Correspondingly, egg sizes significantly decreased in the Garden, while
   they stayed constant over time in the forest. Eggs in bigger clutches
   were more strongly affected by the mollusdcide treatment than eggs in
   smaller clutches. Our quasi-experimental study suggests that Blue Tits
   are sensitive to poor availability of snail shells. This is manifested
   by laying smaller eggs, which require less calcium to be incorporated in
   the eggshell, in response to a dramatic drop in the availability of
   snail shells. This result is expected to raise awareness of potential
   indirect and inadvertent effects of park pest management on biota other
   than molluscan pests.},

Title = {Nest site availability and niche differentiation between two

Number = {20},
Pages = {11904-11910},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Niche differentiation is a key concept in the field of ecology and
   refers to the process by which competing species within an ecological
   community partition utilization of environmental resources to achieve
   coexistence. The existence of niche differentiation is uniquely
   difficult to prove on account of the fact that historical interaction
   among species, which plays a key role in elucidating the current state
   of coexistence among species, is not well known. We created continuous
   niche gradients in nest-site resources between two sympatric secondary
   cavity-nesting birds, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus) and the
   russet sparrow (Passer cinnamomeus), and investigated whether nesting
   site is a factor contributing to limiting breeding overlap by regular
   inspection and 388,160 min of film recording. Our results indicate that
   although we manipulated nest site availability to be uniformly high
   along the habitat gradient, the two bird species have little overlap in
   nest sites and rarely compete for them. Furthermore, the green-backed
   tit possessed a wide range of fundamental niche that covered that of the
   russet sparrow, while their reproductive time was largely segregated.
   The sparrow was more aggressive and outcompeted the tit in their
   overlapped range. These results suggest that even though nesting sites
   are crucial to the reproduction of cavity-nesting birds, some other
   factor plays a more important role in limiting niche overlap between
   sparrows and tits in space and time. Given that these two cavity-nesting
   birds continued to use different habitats and breed in segregated time
   after our manipulation, their relationship is better explained by the
   ghost of competition past theory.},

Title = {Arctic greening and bird nest predation risk across tundra ecotones},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Pages = {607+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Alarming global-scale declines of bird numbers are occurring under the
   changing climate(1), and species belonging to alpine and Arctic tundra
   are particularly affected(2,3). Increased nest predation appears to be
   involved(4), but the mechanisms linking predation to climate change
   remain to be shown. Here we test the prediction from food web theory
   that increased primary productivity (greening of tundra) in a warming
   Arctic leads to a higher risk of nest predation in tundra ecosystems. By
   exploiting landscape-scale spatial heterogeneity in areas of primary
   productivity across alpine tundra ecotones and supplied with
   experimental nests in sub-Arctic Scandinavia, we found that predation
   risk indeed increased with primary productivity. The
   productivity-predation risk relation was independent of the simultaneous
   effects of rodent population dynamics and vegetation cover at nest
   sites. Predation risk also increased steeply with altitude, implying
   that species at the high-altitude end of the alpine tundra ecotones are
   particularly vulnerable. Our study contributes to an improved
   understanding of how climate change may affect Arctic and alpine
   ecosystems and threaten endemic biodiversity through a trophic cascade.},

Title = {Ecosystem services and disservices by birds, bats and monkeys change

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {56},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2069-2078},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The relative importance of ecosystem services and disservices can change
   with landscape structure in a poorly understood way. We compare the
   impact of biocontrol, provided by bats and birds, with that of crop
   raiding by vervet monkeys on yield in South African macadamia orchards.
   Insectivorous bats and birds are known to feed on macadamia pest insect
   species, like the macadamia nut borer or the green vegetable bug. Vervet
   monkeys move into the orchards during the day to feed on premature
   macadamia nuts. Bats, birds and monkeys benefit from patches of natural
   vegetation adjacent to orchards. With exclusion experiments (four
   treatments: day, night, day and night, control) we quantified the
   relative importance of biocontrol and crop raiding on yield, comparing
   two different landscape settings of the orchards, a natural and a
   human-modified. Crop raiding occurred only close to natural vegetation
   and caused yield losses of about 26\%. Biocontrol by bats and birds was
   higher near natural vegetation, but still significant in human-modified
   landscapes, at up to 530 m distance to forest patches. Prevented
   biocontrol through the exclusion of bats and birds resulted in yield
   losses of up to 60\%. Effects of biocontrol by bats and birds (USD
   \~{}5,000 ha/year) were economically more important than the losses of
   crop raiding (USD \~{}1,600 ha/year). As both are linked to the vicinity
   of forest patches, the removal of natural vegetation to limit monkey
   abundances would also limit biocontrol service provision. Synthesis and
   applications. This study highlights the high economic benefits of
   biocontrol by bats and birds, which outweighed negative impacts through
   yield losses caused by crop raiding monkeys. Management practices to
   prevent crop damage, such as guarding, excluding vertebrates or removal
   of adjacent natural vegetation, would also limit access for bats and
   birds and the great economic benefits provided by their biocontrol.
   Ecosystem services by bats and birds can be promoted by the exposure of
   artificial roost and nest sites, but research into species-specific
   preferences is needed. The education of farmers is crucial, as many are
   unaware of the benefits from birds and bats and the fact that these
   benefits can outweigh the disadvantages of the monkeys' crop raiding.},

Title = {No evidence of a demographic response to experimental herbicide
   treatments by the White-crowned Sparrow, an early successional forest
   songbird},
Journal = {CONDOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {121},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Early-successional forest birds, which depend on disturbance events
   within forested landscapes, have received increased conservation concern
   because of long-term population declines. Herbicides are often used to
   control vegetation within early-successional forests, with unknown
   effects on avian vital rates. We used a large-scale experiment to test
   how nest and post-fledging survival were influenced by herbicide
   intensity within managed conifer plantations across 2 breeding seasons.
   We created a gradient of 4 stand-scale herbicide treatments (light,
   moderate, and intensive, and no-spray control) and evaluated the
   reproductive response of the White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia
   leucophrys), a declining songbird in managed forest landscapes of the
   Pacific Northwest. Against initial predictions, we found no evidence
   that either daily nest survival (n > 760 nests across all treatments) or
   post-fledging survival (n = 70 individuals reared in control and
   moderate treatments) were influenced by herbicide application intensity.
   Increased herbicide intensity resulted in an extensive reduction in
   vegetation cover at both stand and nest-patch scales; in contrast,
   vegetative cover at nest sites did not differ across herbicide
   treatments, nor was nest survival related to vegetation concealment
   measures. As the largest experimental investigation to assess forest
   herbicide effects on songbird demography, our study indicates that
   components of sparrow reproductive success were not influenced by
   experimental vegetation control measures, although additional work on
   other early-successional species will be useful to evaluate the
   generalities of our findings.},

Title = {Egg retrieval versus egg rejection in cuckoo hosts},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {374},
Number = {1769},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Before complex nests evolved, birds laid eggs on the ground, and egg
   retrieval evolved as an adaptation against accidental displacement of
   eggs outside the nest. Therefore, egg retrieval is an ancient, and
   likely ancestral, widespread behaviour in birds. However, it has
   received little attention in studies of avian brood parasitism, perhaps
   because most parasitism occurs in species with complex nests, a context
   in which egg retrieval seems irrelevant. However, for cavity-nesting
   hosts of avian brood parasites, egg retrieval may still play an
   important role in the coevolutionary interactions between obligate brood
   parasites and hosts, because egg retrieval can be considered to be
   antagonistic to egg rejection behaviour in hosts, yet both may involve
   cognition to recognize eggs. We hypothesized that (1) cavity-nesting
   hosts should retrieve misplaced eggs from outside the nest cup, (2)
   brood parasitism has modulated egg retrieval behaviour in cavity-nesting
   hosts and (3) hosts use the same visual cues for decision-making during
   egg recognition in both egg retrieval and egg rejection actions. To test
   these hypotheses, we performed a series of experiments in a
   cavity-nesting host, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus). Foreign
   eggs with different levels of mimicry were placed within or outside nest
   cups of hosts to test their responses. We found that host decisions
   about whether to retrieve or reject an egg both depended on the degree
   of mimicry. However, hosts sometimes first retrieved poorly mimetic
   foreign eggs and then rejected them. Alternatively, hosts sometimes
   failed to retrieve highly mimetic conspecific eggs. We suggest that egg
   retrieval in hosts is likely to be a result of the interaction between
   ancient retrieval behaviour and subsequent adaptation against brood
   parasitism.

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is ubiquitous in the sagebrush (Artemisia
   spp.) biome of western North America. Widespread, long-term population
   declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have
   elicited concern about negative effects of livestock grazing on
   sage-grouse populations. Hypothesized relationships, mostly untested,
   between livestock and sage-grouse nesting ecology have played a
   prominent role in shaping public land livestock grazing policy and
   broader discussions about management of grazing in sagebrush ecosystems.
   We tested predictions arising from several commonly hypothesized
   mechanisms by which livestock may affect nesting habitat quality for
   sage-grouse in a grazed landscape in central Montana, USA. We employed
   Bayesian variable selection methods to identify factors related to both
   nest site selection and nest success, focusing on indices of livestock
   use at local and pasture scales and including other factors known to
   influence nesting ecology such as anthropogenic features and weather. In
   spite of some evidence nest survival was positively associated with
   senesced vegetation height, evidence for effects of livestock presence
   and indices of local livestock use on nest site selection and survival
   was equivocal at best. In contrast, we found strong evidence that
   females selected nest sites based on relatively static features such as
   sagebrush cover and distance from gravel and paved roads, whereas nest
   failure was driven primarily by extended periods of heavy precipitation.
   Management of sage-grouse nesting habitat in this region should focus on
   conserving areas of adequate shrub cover and preventing further
   fragmentation by roads. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.
   We tested several hypotheses relating livestock grazing and herbaceous
   vegetation height and cover to sage-grouse nest site selection and
   survival as part of a grazing experiment in central Montana, USA.
   Evidence for effects of grazing and herbaceous vegetation on nest site
   selection and survival was weak, whereas evidence for effects of shrub
   structure, roads, and weather was unequivocal.},

Title = {An experimental test of the effect of food and antioxidants on
   blue-green eggshell coloration in mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have long debated the functional relevance of
   the ornamental traits that occur in many animal taxa, and yet, female
   ornaments have received relatively little attention compared to those
   produced by males. A greater understanding of these traits, particularly
   those that are unique to females, may shed light on the potential for
   sexual selection to shape female phenotypes. Recently, blue-green
   eggshell colour, derived from the antioxidant pigment biliverdin, has
   been proposed as a candidate trait that advertises female quality to
   males in species of birds with biparental care. However, studies have
   been equivocal in their support for blue-green eggshell colour being an
   informative signal, and correlations between eggshell colour and other
   female characteristics have been inconsistent. We conducted a
   supplementation experiment to test if improving the access of female
   birds to food resources and micronutrients, thereby improving their
   condition prior to egg laying, would intensify the blue-green
   colouration of the eggs they laid. We provided mountain bluebirds Sialia
   currucoides with food and carotenoids during nest building and egg
   laying in two breeding seasons, and assessed both within- and
   among-clutch variation in colour. Supplementation did not affect
   patterns of within-clutch variation, but did result in differences in
   colour among clutches. Specifically, we found that food, but not
   carotenoids, resulted in higher colour saturation, and decreased the
   brightness of blue-green eggshells. Although this trend was observed in
   both years, the effect was statistically significant only in one year.
   Our results suggest that food supplementation influences eggshell
   colour, but that conditions, such as weather and natural food
   availability, which can vary annually, may also determine how female
   birds allocate pigment to eggshells.},

Abstract = {Plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) when they are
   attacked by herbivorous arthropods to attract natural enemies of the
   herbivores. Previous studies have suggested that insectivorous birds can
   detect the HIPVs for prey location. The production of HIPVs is partly
   mediated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate is
   one compound involved in the jasmonic acid signalling pathway.
   Therefore, spraying of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) solution on plants can
   induce the emission of volatiles similar to the HIPVs induced by
   herbivory. We performed two field experiments to test whether
   insectivorous adult birds are attracted to Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus
   pyrenaica) treated with MeJa solutions. We used artificial larvae to
   measure bird predation rate. There were no differences in the predation
   rates of plasticine larvae between control and MeJa treatments,
   suggesting that insectivorous birds were not attracted to trees treated
   with MeJa. We also tested whether blue tit nestlings without previous
   experience in foraging respond to the scent of Pyrenean oak tree leaves
   treated with MeJa, to test whether the attraction to MeJa-treated trees
   is innate. A similar number of nestlings performed begging responses
   when exposed to the scent of leaves of MeJa-treated trees compared to
   the scent of leaves of control untreated trees. Furthermore, the
   duration of the first begging was similar in response to the volatiles
   emitted by MeJa-treated trees and untreated trees. Despite previous
   evidence suggesting that insectivorous birds are attracted to HIPVs, our
   results show that neither insectivorous adult birds nor inexperienced
   nestlings were attracted to trees treated with MeJa. Further studies are
   needed to disentangle whether the differences in the emission of
   volatiles between herbivore-infested trees and MeJa-treated trees can
   explain this lack of attraction to MeJa-treated Pyrenean oak trees.},

Abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is a ubiquitous land use in the sagebrush
   (Artemisia spp.) biome of western North America. Widespread, long-term
   population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)
   have elicited concern about potential negative effects of livestock
   management practices on sage-grouse populations. We evaluated how
   recently implemented rotational grazing systems affected sage-grouse
   nesting habitat quality as part of a large-scale, replicated, natural
   experiment in central Montana, USA. We used Bayesian methods to assess
   support for effects of rotational grazing management and rest from
   grazing on daily survival rates of nearly 500 sage-grouse nests
   monitored over 6 years, and mixed effects models to test for effects of
   rotational grazing and rest on vegetation structure. Though nests on
   rotationally grazed ranches displayed a trend toward greater daily
   survival rates, the evidence for an effect was weak. There was no
   evidence that rest from grazing (12 months) increased daily survival
   rates. Furthermore, rotational grazing systems and rest had negligible
   effects on herbaceous vegetation height and cover relative to other
   grazing strategies used in the study area. Results do not support the
   hypothesis that rotational grazing systems or rest from grazing increase
   nest success in the northern Great Plains. Estimated nest success,
   however, was comparable to range-wide averages, suggesting concealing
   cover for nests is unlikely to be limiting growth of this population
   regardless of grazing strategy. In light of these results and recent
   research questioning reported relationships between grass height and
   nest survival, maximization of hiding cover may be overemphasized in
   grazing management guidelines and policies. Rather, our findings suggest
   a variety of locally appropriate grazing strategies focused on
   fundamental range health principles may provide adequate habitat quality
   for nesting sage-grouse. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.

Abstract = {Structural complexity is widely recognized as an inherent characteristic
   of unmanaged forests critical to their function and resilience, but
   often reduced in their managed counterparts. Variable retention
   harvesting (VRH) has been proposed as a way to restore or enhance
   structural complexity in managed forests, and thereby sustain attendant
   biodiversity and ecosystem function. Here we examined the decade-long
   response of diurnal breeding birds to a VRH experiment that, for the
   first time, incorporated both overstory and shrub layer treatments in
   red pine (Pines resinosa) dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Overstory
   treatments included dispersed retention, aggregated retention achieved
   by cutting small (0.1 ha) gaps, aggregated retention achieved by cutting
   large (0.3 ha) gaps, and an uncut control. A shrub layer treatment of
   ambient or reduced shrub density was also implemented as a split-plot
   design in each harvest treatment. We found a consistent increase in bird
   species richness and abundance with all retention harvest treatments
   over time compared to the control; species richness was also
   significantly greater in the large gap-aggregated treatment compared to
   dispersed and small gap-aggregated retention harvests. Among guilds,
   foliage-gleaning and shrub- and tree-nesting birds exhibited the
   strongest positive response to retention harvesting. Species associated
   with early-successional habitat, forest edges, and shrubs responded most
   positively to VRH including Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga
   pensylvanica) and American Restart (S. ruticilla), although
   late-successional species such as Blackburnian Warbler (S. fusca) and
   Black-throated Green Warbler (S. Wrens) also showed positive response.
   We found few differences due to shrub reduction, and only at the species
   level: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and American Redstart were more
   abundant in the ambient shrub treatment, whereas Brown Creeper (Certhia
   americana), Veery (Catharus fuscenscens), and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella
   passerina) were more abundant with a reduced density of shrubs. Results
   through the first 10 years following harvest revealed differences in
   bird response to both VRH and shrub treatment, suggesting that
   management can result in forested landscapes with bird communities that
   are species rich, diverse, and abundant.},

   nest-building materials used by parents},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {89-100},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Nest materials used by animals can have profound effects on developing
   offspring. They can modify the bacterial and parasitic environment of
   the nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual
   signalling processes. In spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, green
   plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The
   aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on
   nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of
   their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored
   these effects in two different populations, together with the potential
   effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and
   nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on
   population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these
   effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere
   attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in
   general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the
   experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres.
   Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in
   general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the
   experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with
   longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of
   staphylococci on the skin of 8-day-old nestlings was negatively related
   to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest
   a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere
   length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by
   the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or
   by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal
   effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these
   experimental effects. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {48},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Patterns of natal dispersal are generally sex-biased in vertebrates,
   i.e. female-biased in birds and male-biased in mammals. Interphyletic
   comparisons in mammals suggest that male-biased dispersal occurs in
   polygynous and promiscuous species where local mate competition among
   males exceeds local resource competition among females. However, few
   studies have analysed sex-biased patterns of dispersal at the individual
   level, and facultatively polygynous species might offer this
   opportunity. In the spotless starling, polygynous males exhibit their
   mating status during courtship carrying higher amounts of green plants
   to nests than monogamous males. We experimentally incorporated green
   plants to nests during four years to analyse long-term consequences on
   breeding success and offspring recruitment rates. We unexpectedly found
   that experimental sons recruited farther than experimental daughters,
   while control daughters recruited farther than control sons. A similar
   pattern was found using observational information from eight years. We
   discuss this result in the context of local competition hypothesis and
   speculate that sons dispersed farther from nests controlled by
   polygynous males to avoid competition with relatives. The amount of
   green plants in nests affects female perception of male attractiveness
   and degree of polygyny, although little is known about proximate
   mechanisms linking this process with the offspring dispersal behaviour.
   Our results support the idea that male-biased dispersal is related to
   polygyny in a facultatively polygynous bird.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Surface coal mining and subsequent reclamation of surface mines have
   converted large forest areas into early successional vegetative
   communities in the eastern United States. This reclamation can provide a
   novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus).
   We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest
   survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed
   and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife
   Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to
   2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis,
   and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK,
   between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the
   composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat)
   and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e.,
   microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection
   relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking,
   prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was
   influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites
   in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites.
   On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was
   applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with
   areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced
   by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced
   by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age.
   Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the
   breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring
   later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not
   influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but
   broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control
   sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked
   native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our
   results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without
   manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a
   low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for
   nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g.,
   nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported
   in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies
   caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands
   dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as
   disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea
   lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing
   bobwhite. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

Abstract = {The Woodlark is an insectivorous bird, which is listed as a priority
   species in Switzerland. In Valais, a stronghold of this species in the
   country, the birds breed in intensively managed vineyards and show a
   preference for parcels with ground vegetation during territory
   establishment. As a ground-breeder, the species is highly vulnerable to
   nest predation by avian and mammal predators. The aims of our study were
   firstly to investigate nest site preferences of the woodlark within
   vineyards and secondly to compare the predation risk of artificial nests
   dependent of ground vegetation structure. Our results point out that the
   Woodlark prefers patches of tall and dense ground cover within vegetated
   vineyard parcels and avoids parcels that have been treated with
   herbicides. In a follow-up experiment we conducted a study comparing the
   predation rate of artificial nests between bare parcels (<20\% vegetated
   area) and vegetated parcels (>40\% vegetated area). Artificial nests
   equipped with one quail egg were distributed pairwise between two
   adjacent parcels that fulfilled the upper criteria and were monitored by
   trail cameras during 10-12 days. Predation rate was generally low (4
   predation events) and only occurred in bare parcels. These data indicate
   that conspicuousness of avian nests may be decreased in vegetated
   parcels and that the amount of vegetation can lower the predation risk
   on ground breeding birds another indication for the importance of ground
   vegetation for a successful conservation of the endangered Woodlark in
   Swiss vineyards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The potential of fallow lands to favor farmland bird conservation is
   widely recognized. Since fallows provide key resources for birds within
   the agricultural matrix, such as nesting sites, shelter and forage,
   complete understanding of the effect of field-management strategies on
   vegetation structure and food is essential to fulfill bird requirements
   and improve habitat management. In this study we experimentally compare
   the most common field practices (ploughing, shredding, herbicide
   application and cover cropping) on fallow lands by assessing the
   resources they provide for birds in terms of vegetation structure and
   food resources (leaf and seed availability), as well as the economic
   costs of their implementation. Fallow management treatments are ranked
   for six target species in a lowland area of the north-eastern Iberian
   Peninsula, according to the available information on their requirements.
   The different agronomic practices offer various quantities and types of
   resources, highlighting the importance of fallow management in bird
   conservation. Shredding and early herbicide application (February) are
   estimated to be good practices for Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and
   Calandra Lark (Melanocorypha calandra), providing both favorable habitat
   and foraging conditions, while being economical. Meanwhile, superficial
   tillage in spring is found to be optimum for the rest of the species

Abstract = {Avian eggs exhibit a large variability in coloration and patterns, which
   are produced by blue-green biliverdin and red-brown protoporphyrin
   pigments. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function
   of eggshell coloration. In this experimental study, we tested two
   hypotheses (signalling-function hypothesis and structural-function
   hypothesis) on both eggshell pigment types in an open-nesting songbird,
   the canary (Serinus canaria). Also, we aimed to examine whether
   deposition of pigments into the eggshell has any cost in terms of the
   plasma oxidative status of the female. We found that eggshell average
   blue-green chroma was increased by antioxidant supplementation, although
   we note that there had already been a pre-existing bias in plasma
   antioxidant capacity between the supplemented and control groups.
   Eggshell average blue-green chroma was positively related to female body
   condition during egg laying. However, blue-green eggshell colour was not
   related to female oxidative status during or after the laying period,
   and blue-green chroma increased with laying order. Accordingly, we found
   some support for that eggshell blue-green colour could reflect maternal
   antioxidant availability and body condition, but did not find evidence
   that it has a cost for the female's oxidative status. By contrast,
   eggshell spot brightness was positively related to body condition,
   suggesting that darker spotting reflected poorer nutritional condition
   in the canary. Eggshell blue-green pigmentation was not significantly
   connected to the egg volume or yolk antioxidant level, but we found that
   eggs with lower yolk antioxidant concentration had higher average
   eggshell brown chroma. In sum, our results suggest that eggshell colour
   reflected female antioxidant and nutrient availability. Finally, we
   found that eggs with thinner eggshells had a more aggregated spot
   distribution, supporting the view that aggregated spots may help to
   strengthen eggshells.
   Significance statement
   Avian eggs have a large variability in colours and patterns, which are
   due to two pigments: the blue-green biliverdin and the red-brown
   protoporphyrin. In this study, we tested whether eggshell pigmentation,
   measured by a spectrophotometer, could reflect female and egg quality in
   the canary, an open nesting songbird. We found that females supplemented
   with antioxidants before and during egg-laying laid more intense
   blue-green eggs. Females in better body condition laid eggs that had a
   more intense blue-green coloration, but lower intensity of brown
   coloration. Egg yolk antioxidant level was lower in eggs with more
   intense brown eggshell coloration. These results suggest that eggshell
   coloration could reflect the antioxidant and nutrient availability of
   females. Moreover, we found that eggs with thinner eggshells had a more
   aggregated spot distribution on the eggshell, supporting the view that
   aggregated brown pigment spots may help to strengthen eggshells.},

Abstract = {The simplification and homogenisation of agricultural landscapes has led
   to dramatic losses of farmland biodiversity. This decline includes
   passerine populations and one of the mechanisms that may be contributing
   toward this may be increased nest predation. ground covers are
   agri-environmental measures whose objective is to halt the loss of
   biodiversity by creating high-quality habitat patches embedded in a
   homogeneous landscape by maintaining herbaceous ground cover within
   crops. however, although such patches are selected by breeding birds,
   they may also attract predators, and an increased nest density in small
   habitat patches would thus result in increased predation rates. We have
   therefore performed nest predation experiments with artificial nests in
   order to investigate whether the effect of ground cover on nest
   predation is density dependent. The experiments were carried out during
   the breeding season in 2014, in two areas of olive groves in southern
   Spain. We used two nest density levels, both in olive groves with ground
   cover and in those where the ground was bare. A total of 420 nests were
   placed, 226 of which (53.81\%) suffered predation. Our results showed
   that 1) nest predation was density dependent in olive groves with ground
   cover only with respect to tree nests, while there was no
   density-dependent predation in bare-ground olive groves of either
   ground-based or tree nests, and 2) artificial nests placed on the ground
   were more frequently depredated (65\%) than those placed in trees
   (29\%), irrespective of either the presence of vegetation cover or nest
   density. This study suggests that variations in patterns of nest
   predation are determined by the identity of nest predators and their
   specific foraging behaviours in different landscapes and habitats. It

Title = {Do Wild Great Tits Avoid Exposure to Light at Night?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Studies of wild populations have provided important insights into the
   effects of artificial light at night on organisms, populations and
   ecosystems. However, in most studies the exact amount of light at night
   individuals are exposed to remains unknown. Individuals can potentially
   control their nighttime light exposure by seeking dark spots within
   illuminated areas. This uncertainty makes it difficult to attribute
   effects to a direct effect of light at night, or to indirect effects,
   e.g., via an effect of light at night on food availability. In this
   study, we aim to quantify the nocturnal light exposure of wild birds in
   a previously dark forest-edge habitat, experimentally illuminated with
   three different colors of street lighting, in comparison to a dark
   control. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we deployed male great
   tits (Parus major) with a light logger measuring light intensity every
   five minutes over a 24h period. We found that three males from pairs
   breeding in brightly illuminated nest boxes close to green and red lamp
   posts, were not exposed to more artificial light at night than males
   from pairs breeding further away. This suggests, based on our limited
   sample size, that these males could have been avoiding light at night by
   choosing a roosting place with a reduced light intensity. Therefore,
   effects of light at night previously reported for this species in our
   experimental set-up might be indirect. In contrast to urban areas where
   light is omnipresent, bird species in non-urban areas may evade exposure
   to nocturnal artificial light, thereby avoiding direct consequences of
   light at night.},

Abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to nitrite reduction
   (AOM-NIR) is ecologically significant for mitigating the methane-induced
   greenhouse effect. The microbes responsible for this reaction, NC10
   bacteria, have been widely detected in diverse ecosystems. However, some
   defects were discovered in the commonly used NC10-specific primers, 202F
   and qP1F. In the present work, the primers were redesigned and improved
   to overcome the defects found in the previous primers. A new nested PCR
   method was developed using the improved primers to amplify 16S ribosomal
   RNA (rRNA) genes from NC10 bacteria. In the new nested PCR method, the
   qP1mF/1492R and 1051F/qP2R primer sets were used in the first and second
   rounds, respectively. The PCR products were sequenced, and more
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the NC10 phylum were obtained
   using the new primers compared to the previous primers. The sensitivity
   of the new nested PCR was tested by the serial dilution method, and the
   limit of detection was approximately 10(3) copies g(-1) dry sed. for the
   environmental samples compared to approximately 10(5) copies g(-1) dry
   sed. by the previous method. Finally, the improved primer, qP1mF, was
   used in quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of NC10
   bacteria, and the results agreed well with the activity of AOM-NIR
   measured by isotope tracer experiments. The improved primers are able to
   amplify NC10 16S rRNA genes more efficiently than the previous primers
   and useful to explore the microbial community of the NC10 phylum in
   different systems.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Numerical experiments of oil bioremediation of tidally influenced beach
   were simulated using the model BIOMARUN. Nutrient and dissolved oxygen
   were assumed present in a solution applied on the exposed beach face,
   and the concentration of these amendments was tracked throughout the
   beach for up to 6 months. It was found that, in comparison to natural
   attenuation, bioremediation increased the removal efficiency by 76\% and
   65\% for alkanes and aromatics, respectively. Increasing the nutrient
   concentration in the applied solution did not always enhance
   biodegradation as oxygen became limiting even when the beach was
   originally oxygen-rich. Therefore, replenishment of oxygen to
   oil-contaminated zone was also essential. Stimulation of oil
   biodegradation was more evident in the upper and midintertidal zone of
   the beach, and less in the lower intertidal zone. This was due to
   reduced nutrient and oxygen replenishment, as very little of the
   amendment solution reached that zone. It was found that under continual
   application, most of the oil biodegraded within 2 months, while it
   persisted for 6 months under natural conditions. While the difference in
   duration suggests minimal long-term effects, there are situations where
   the beach would need to be cleaned for major ecological functions, such
   as temporary nesting or feeding for migratory birds. Biochemical
   retention time map (BRTM) showed that the duration of solution
   application was dependent upon the stimulated oil biodegradation rate.
   By contrast, the application rate of the amendment solution was
   dependent upon the subsurface extent of the oil-contaminated zone.
   Delivery of nutrient and oxygen into coastal beach involved complex
   interaction among amendment solution, groundwater, and seawater.
   Therefore, approaches that ignore the hydrodynamics due to tide are
   unlikely to provide the optimal solutions for shoreline bioremediation.},

Title = {Internal seed dispersal by parrots: an overview of a neglected mutualism},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Despite the fact that parrots (Psitacifforrnes) are generalist apex
   frugivores, they have largely been considered plant antagonists and thus
   neglected as seed dispersers of their food plants. Internal dispersal
   was investigated by searching for seeds in faeces opportunistically
   collected at communal roosts, foraging sites and nests of eleven parrot
   species in different habitats and biomes in the Neotropics. Multiple
   intact seeds of seven plant species of five families were found in a
   variable proportion of faeces from four parrot species. The mean number
   of seeds of each plant species per dropping ranged between one and about
   sixty, with a maximum of almost five hundred seeds from the cacti
   Pilosacereus pachydadus in a single dropping of Lear's Macaw
   (Anodorhynchus leari). All seeds retrieved were small (<3 mm) and
   corresponded to herbs and relatively large, multiple-seeded fleshy
   berries and infrutescences from shrubs, trees and columnar cacti, often
   also dispersed by stornatochory. An overview of the potential
   constraints driving seed dispersal suggest that, despite the obvious
   size difference between seeds dispersed by endozoochory and
   stornatochory, there is no clear difference in fruit size depending on
   the dispersal mode. Regardless of the enhanced or limited germination
   capability after gut transit, a relatively large proportion of cacti
   seeds frequently found in the faeces of two parrot species were viable
   according to the tetrazolium test and germination experiments. The
   conservative results of our exploratory sampling and a literature review
   clearly indicate that the importance of parrots as endozoochorous
   dispersers has been largely under-appreciated due to the lack of
   research systematically searching for seeds in their faeces. We
   encourage the evaluation of seed dispersal and other mutualistic
   interactions mediated by parrots before their generalized population
   declines contribute to the collapse of key ecosystem processes.},

Abstract = {Livestock grazing has shaped grassland ecosystems around the world.
   Previous studies indicated grazing showed various impacts on small
   rodents; however, most studies were conducted over 1-2 years without
   controlling for confounding factors such as immigration/emigration and
   predation in rodents. Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are
   generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic
   herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because
   they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the
   ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is
   essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these
   needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to
   assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population
   density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities
   by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to
   livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to
   the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the
   first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the
   following 3 years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and
   male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity.
   Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced
   deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of
   less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total
   phenol content). Our findings highlight the urgent need for more
   flexible management of yearly rotational grazing to optimize livestock
   production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.},

Abstract = {Nest predation is assumed to be an important factor driving avian life
   histories. Altitudinal gradients offer valuable study systems to
   investigate how avian nest predation risk varies between bird
   populations. In this study, a hypothesis postulating an increase in
   avian nest survival rate with elevation as a result of decreasing
   predation pressure was experimentally tested along an altitudinal
   gradient (300-2250m) in West-Central Africa. Three types of artificial
   nests (cup-shrub, cup-ground and bare-ground) were used along the
   altitudinal gradient. Overall, elevation had no effect on the daily
   survival rate (DSR) of the artificial nests. However, there was a
   significant elevation-nest type interaction. Daily survival rate for
   cup-shrub nests decreased significantly with elevation, but for
   cup-ground and bare-ground nests, elevation had no significant effect.
   We tested the effects of the same vegetation parameters (tree density,
   herb and shrub layer coverage, and canopy openness) on the DSR of
   different nest types to understand how different vegetation layers or
   combinations of them affect DSR. Daily survival rate for bare-ground
   nests significantly decreased with increasing canopy openness, and was
   positively influenced by coverage of herb layer and tree density. For
   cup-shrub nests, DSR increased significantly with increasing shrub layer
   coverage. Finally, for cup-ground nests, we found a positive effect of
   shrub coverage and canopy openness on DSR. In summary, we found that
   different forest vegetation layers affect predation risk of different

Title = {Evidence of low toxicity of oil sands process-affected water to birds
   invites re-evaluation of avian protection strategies},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Exposure to water containing petroleum waste products can generate both
   overt and subtle toxicological responses in wildlife, including birds.
   Such exposure can occur in the tailings ponds of the mineable oil sands,
   which are located in Alberta, Canada, under a major continental flyway
   for waterfowl. Over the 40 year history of the industry, a few thousand
   bird deaths have been reported following contact with bitumen on the
   ponds, but a new monitoring programme demonstrated that many thousands
   of birds land annually without apparent harm. This new insight creates
   an urgent need for more information on the sublethal effects on birds
   from non-bitumen toxicants that occur in the water, including naphthenic
   acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and salts. Ten
   studies have addressed the effects of oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW), and none reported acute or substantial adverse health effects.
   Interpretive caution is warranted, however, because nine of the studies
   addressed reclaimed wetlands that received OSPW, not OSPW ponds per se,
   and differences between experimental and reference sites may have been
   reduced by shared sources of pollution in the surrounding air and water.
   Two studies examined eggs of birds nesting >100 km from the mine sites.
   Only one study exposed birds directly and repeatedly to OSPW and found
   no consistent differences between treated and control birds in
   blood-based health metrics. If it is true that aged forms of OSPW do not
   markedly affect the health of birds that land briefly on the ponds, then
   the extensiveness of current bird-deterrent programmes is unwarranted
   and could exert negative net environmental effects. More directed
   research on bird health is urgently needed, partly because birds that
   land on these ponds subsequently migrate to destinations throughout
   North America where they are consumed by both humans and wildlife
   predators.},

Abstract = {Obligate brood parasitic birds exploit their hosts to provide care for
   unrelated young in the nest. Potential hosts can reduce the cost of
   parasitism by rejecting foreign eggs from the nest. Observational,
   comparative, and experimental studies have concluded that most hosts use
   the coloration and patterning of eggshells to discriminate between own
   and foreign eggs in the nest. However, an alternative hypothesis is that
   birds use the colour contrasts between eggshells and the nest lining to
   identify parasitic eggs (egg-nest contrast hypothesis). In support of
   this hypothesis, we found that the avian perceivable chromatic contrasts
   between dyed eggs and unmanipulated nest linings significantly and
   negatively covaried with the rejection rates of different dyed eggs of
   the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a frequently
   parasitized host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To experimentally
   test whether egg-nest contrasts influence rejection, we reciprocally
   dyed both eggs and the nest lining of this host species with one of two
   colours: orange and green. Contrary to the egg-nest contrast hypothesis,
   host rejection patterns in response to dyed eggs were not altered by
   dyeing nests, relative to unmanipulated control eggs and nests. In turn,
   experimental egg colour was the only significant predictor of egg
   rejection rate. Our results demonstrate that egg-nest contrast is a
   collateral, not a causal factor in egg rejection, and confirm the
   conclusions of previous studies that hosts can rely on the parasitic
   egg's appearance itself to recognize the foreign egg in the nest.},

Abstract = {Organisms have evolved under natural daily light/dark cycles for
   millions of years. These cycles have been disturbed as night-time
   darkness is increasingly replaced by artificial illumination.
   Investigating the physiological consequences of free-living organisms in
   artificially lit environments is crucial to determine whether nocturnal
   lighting disrupts circadian rhythms, changes behaviour, reduces fitness
   and ultimately affects population numbers. We make use of a unique,
   large-scale network of replicated field sites which were experimentally
   illuminated at night using lampposts emanating either red, green, white
   or no light to test effect on stress hormone concentrations
   (corticosterone) in a songbird, the great fit (Parus major). Adults
   nesting in white-light transects had higher corticosterone
   concentrations than in the other treatments. We also found a significant
   interaction between distance to the closest lamppost and treatment type:
   individuals in red light had higher corticosterone levels when they
   nested closer to the lamppost than individuals nesting farther away, a
   decline not observed in the green or dark treatment. Individuals with
   high corticosterone levels had fewer fledglings, irrespective of
   treatment. These results show that artificial light can induce changes
   in individual hormonal phenotype. As these effects vary considerably
   with light spectrum, it opens the possibility to mitigate these effects
   by selecting street lighting of specific spectra.},

Abstract = {Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) compete with
   endangered parrots for nest boxes and can hamper conservation efforts.
   We tested an integrated pest management push-pull protocol in the
   Atlantic Forest in SAo Paulo, Brazil, in an effort to prevent bee swarms
   from colonizing nest boxes (N = 30 in the forest plus five in aviaries)
   meant for use by Vinaceous-breasted Amazons (Amazona vinacea). Fifteen
   parrot nest boxes were treated with a permethrin insecticide to push
   scout bees away and each parrot box was paired with a bee trap box
   containing a pheromone lure to pull bees. Over a 1-yr period (March 2013
   to March 2014), 29 insect colonies moved into 18 of the 35 trap boxes.
   Nine Africanized honey bee, three native Jatai bee (Tetragonisca sp.),
   and 17 wasp colonies occupied trap boxes. Only one experimental
   push-pull pair untreated parrot box was invaded by bees and no parrot
   boxes in aviaries were colonized. Four of the parrot nest boxes were
   occupied by birds during our study. Although none were used by
   Vinaceous-breasted Amazons, Southern House Wrens (Troglodytes musculus),
   Green-winged Saltators (Saltator similis), and Plain Parakeets
   (Brotogeris tirica) nested in the boxes and all nests were successful.
   Although long-term studies are needed before drawing conclusions about
   the effectiveness of trap boxes, our results suggest that a push-pull
   protocol may prove useful for reducing the use of nest boxes meant for

   RESUMEN Un esquema integrada de alejar-atraer para el control de plagas
   para la prevencion del uso de cajas nido para loros por las abejas de
   miel Africanizadas invasoras Las abejas de miel Africanizadas (Apis
   mellifera scutellata) compiten con los loros en peligro de extincion
   para las cajas nido y puede impedir los esfuerzos de conservacion.
   Probamos un metodo integrado para el control de plagas, el protocolo de
   alejar-atraer, en el Bosque Atlantico, en SAo Paulo, Brasil, en un
   esfuerzo para evitar que los enjambres de abejas colonicen las cajas
   nido (N = 30 en el bosque, mas cinco en aviarios) destinadas a ser
   utilizadas por el loro Amazona Vinosa (Amazona vinacea). Quince cajas
   nido fueron tratados con una insecticida permetrina para alejar las
   abejas exploradoras de las cajas nido. Las cajas nido tambien fueron
   emparejada con una caja trampa para abejas, que contenia una feromona
   para atraer las abejas. Durante un periodo de un ano (marzo 2013 - marzo
   2014), 29 colonias de insectos se trasladaron a 18 de las 35 cajas
   trampa para abejas. Nueve colonias abejas de miel Africanizada, tres
   colonias abejas nativo Jatai (Tetragonisca sp.) y 17 colonias de avispas
   ocuparon las cajas trampas. Solo un experimento caja nido, emparejada
   con el metodo alejar-atraer, fue invadida por las abejas y ninguna de
   las cajas nido en aviarios fueron colonizados por abejas. Cuatro de las
   cajas nido estaban ocupados por aves durante nuestro estudio. Aunque
   ninguno fue utilizado por el loro Amazona Vinosa, los nidos fueron
   anidados por el Chivirin Raton (Troglodytes musculus), el Pepitero
   Verdoso (Saltator similis) y la Catita Tirica (Brotogeris tirica) y
   todos los nidos fueron exitosos. Aunque se necesitan estudios a largo
   plazo antes de sacar conclusiones acerca de la efectividad de la caja
   trampa para abejas, nuestros resultados sugieren que un protocolo de
   alejar-atraer puede ser util para reducir el uso de nidos de loros, y
   otras aves, por las abejas de miel africanizadas y otros insectos.},

Title = {Glomeromycota associated with Mexican native maize landraces in Los
   Tuxtlas, Mexico},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {63-71},

Abstract = {Many native maize landraces are still cultivated by different ethnic
   groups in Mexico as part of traditional polyculture systems (milpas).
   However, these systems and landraces are being steadily replaced by
   fertilized monocultures of genetically improved varieties or maize
   hybrids. Little is known about how such changes may affect the
   belowground community of maize symbionts. A greenhouse experiment was
   conducted to assess the composition of the indigenous arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities colonizing four Popoluca maize
   landraces and the hybrid Texcoco, and to determine how these communities
   are influenced by the level of phosphorus fertilization. Fragments of
   AMF ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were amplified using nested PCR, producing 327
   Glomeromycota sequences. Phylogenetic analysis assigned the
   Glomeromycota sequences into 84 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). This
   number of OTUs more than doubles the figure previously reported for
   maize exposed to AMF native inoculum. Exclusive or very heterogeneous
   maize type-AMF associations were rare. Most AMF species colonized 2-4
   maize types. This suggests that the high diversity of AMF in milpas is
   related to the presence of several native maize landraces and that
   replacement of these landraces with a single hybrid may diminish AMF
   community richness. All landraces associated with more OTUs under
   moderate P, compared to low P fertilization, suggesting that low
   inorganic phosphate (Pi) in milpas is limiting symbiotic interactions.
   However, only 0-20\% of OTUs were conserved between different P
   conditions for each landrace. The Black landrace, which presented the
   highest AMF colonization and Pi uptake, was associated with the highest
   number of AMF OTUs, supporting previous suggestions regarding this
   functional relationship with AMF richness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Fungal endophytes reduce necrosis length produced by Gremmeniella
   abietina in Pinus halepensis seedlings},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONTROL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {30-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerberg) Morelet is a pathogenic fungus that
   causes severe damage in coniferous forests, causing the death of the
   trees, in Central and Northern Europe, North America and Japan.
   Biological control (i.e. the use of biologically antagonistic organisms)
   is being considered as an alternative and an eco-friendly method to deal
   with plant diseases. Among such organisms several fungal endophytes have
   been successfully used to reduce or inhibit the growth of pathogens.
   Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of several
   fungal endophytes to reduce the G. abietina spreading on pine seedlings,
   with the goal of exploring the mechanisms involved in that reduction.
   The experiment was carried out on two-year old Pinus halepensis
   seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Five fungal endophytes
   (Trichoderma spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Aureobasidium spp.,
   endophyte 20.1 and Leotiomycete spp.) obtained from healthy P.
   halepensis trees were used to evaluate their effect on six G. abietina
   isolates. The pathogen and the endophyte were both inoculated in every
   seedling. At the end of the experiment seedlings were cut and brought to
   the laboratory where the necrosis length and total phenol content of the
   plant were measured. The pathogen presence was determined by a nested
   PCR with specific primers of G. abietina. The presence of all endophytes
   significantly reduced the necrosis length caused by G. abietina in most
   of the cases. However, the phenolic content of the plant, which is an
   indicator of the activation of the plant's defence mechanisms, had not
   increased with the endophyte inoculation. Therefore, the reduction in
   the necrosis observed could be attributed to a direct effect of the
   endophyte on the Gremmeniella spreading. These results suggest that the
   use of fungal endophytes could be an effective way to protect against G.
   abietina infections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Removal of Indoor Carbon Dioxide and Formaldehyde Using Green Walls by
   Bird Nest Fern},

Abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of removing air
   pollutants by installing green vertical walls filled with potted plants.
   Most people in urban areas spend 80-90\% of their lives indoors,
   indicating the significance of indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide (CO2)
   and formaldehyde (HCHO) are the most common sources of indoor pollution;
   their levels can be reduced by using potted plants, which provide the
   additional benefit of beautification. In accordance with our previous
   study, for this purpose, we used bird nest fern (Asplenium nidus Linn.),
   which has a high rate of transpiration and is easy to grow indoors. Upon
   using 3 treatments involving the release of CO2, HCHO, or CO2 + HCHO,
   the experimental results showed that bird nest fern can reduce the
   concentration of CO2 from 2000 ppm to a safe 800 ppm at an average of
   1.984 ppm.11(-1) (per pot). By contrast, the concentration of HCHO was
   reduced from 2 ppm to the safe level of 0.1 ppm, at an average of 0.003
   ppm.h(-1) (per pot). Regarding temperature and humidity, the results
   showed a decrease of 2 degrees C indoors and an increase of 10\%
   relative humidity. These results show that bird nest fern has high rates
   of CO2 and HCHO removal, reduces temperature, and raises relative
   humidity.},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) fluorometers can be used to estimate
   the electron transport rate (ETR) {[}mu mol(e(-)) m(-2) s(-1)] from
   photosynthetic yield determinations, provided the absorptance () of the
   photoorganism is known. The standard assumed value used for absorptance
   is 0.84 (leaf absorptance factor, Abt(F)). We described a
   reflectance-absorptancetransmittance (RAT) meter for routine
   experimental measurements of the actual absorptance of leaves. The RAT
   uses a red-green-blue (RGB) LED diode light source to measure
   absorptances at wavelengths suitable for use with PAM fluorometers and
   infrared gas analysers. Results using the RAT were compared to spectra
   using a Taylor integrating sphere on bird's nest fern (Asplenium nidus),
   banana, Doryanthes excelsa, Kalanchoe daigremontiana, and sugarcane.
   Parallel venation had no significant effect upon Abt(465) in banana,
   Doryanthes, a Dendrobium orchid, pineapple, and sugarcane, but there was
   a slight difference in the case of the fern A. nidus. The average
   Abt(465) (a parts per thousand 0.96) and Abt(625) (a parts per thousand
   0.89) were a parts per thousand 14\% and 6\% higher than the standard
   value (Abt(F) = 0.84). The PAR-range Abt(400-700) was only a parts per
   thousand 5\% higher than the standard value (a parts per thousand 0.88)
   based on averaged absorptance from the blue, green, and red light data
   and from where the RGB-diode was used as a `white' light source. In some
   species, absorptances at blue and red wavelengths are quite different
   (e.g. water lily). Reflectance measurements of leaves using the RAT
   would also be useful for remote sensing studies.},

Title = {Hoopoes color their eggs with antimicrobial uropygial secretions},
Journal = {NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {101},
Number = {9},
Pages = {697-705},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Uropygial gland secretions are used as cosmetics by some species of
   birds to color and enhance properties of feathers and teguments, which
   may signal individual quality. Uropygial secretions also reach eggshells
   during incubation and, therefore, may influence the coloration of birds'
   eggs, a trait that has attracted the attention of evolutionary
   biologists for more than one century. The color of hoopoe eggs typically
   changes along incubation, from bluish-gray to greenish-brown. Here, we
   test experimentally the hypothesis that dark uropygial secretion of
   females is responsible for such drastic color change. Moreover, since
   uropygial secretion of hoopoes has antimicrobial properties, we also
   explore the association between color and antimicrobial activity of the
   uropygial secretion of females. We found that eggs stayed bluish-gray in
   nests where female access to the uropygial secretion was experimentally
   blocked. Furthermore, experimental eggs that were maintained in
   incubators and manually smeared with uropygial secretion experienced
   similar color changes that naturally incubated eggs did, while control
   eggs that were not in contact with the secretions did not experience
   such color changes. All these results strongly support the hypothesis
   that female hoopoes use their uropygial gland secretion to color the
   eggs. Moreover, saturation of the uropygial secretion was associated
   with antimicrobial activity against Bacillus licheniformis. Given the
   known antimicrobial potential of uropygial secretions of birds, this
   finding opens the possibility that in scenarios of sexual selection,
   hoopoes in particular and birds in general signal antimicrobial
   properties of their uropygial secretion by mean of changes in egg
   coloration along incubation.},

Abstract = {Endophytic fungi are known to be commonly associated with herbaceous
   plants, however, there are few studies focusing on their occurrence and
   distribution in plant roots from ecosystems with different land uses. To
   explore the phylogenetic diversity and community structure of
   Sebacinales endophytes from agricultural and grassland habitats under
   different land uses, we analysed the roots of herbaceous plants using
   strain isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and co-cultivation experiments. A new sebacinoid strain
   named Serendipita herbamans belonging to Sebacinales group B was
   isolated from the roots of Bistorta vivipara, which is characterized by
   colourless monilioid cells (chlamydospores) that become yellow with age.
   This species was very common and widely distributed in association with
   a broad spectrum of herbaceous plant families in diverse habitats,
   independent of land use type. Ultrastructurally, the presence of S.
   herbamans was detected in the cortical cells of Plantago media,
   Potentilla anserina and Triticum aestivum. In addition, 13 few frequent
   molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) or species were found
   across agricultural and grassland habitats, which did not exhibit a
   distinctive phylogenetic structure. Laboratory-based assays indicate
   that S. herbamans has the ability to colonize fine roots and stimulate
   plant growth. Although endophytic Sebacinales are widely distributed
   across agricultural and grassland habitats, TEM and nested PCR analyses
   reinforce the observation that these microorganisms are present in low
   quantity in plant roots, with no evidence of host specificity.},

Title = {Exclusion of deer affects responses of birds to woodland regeneration in

Journal = {IBIS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {156},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-131},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Using an exclosure experiment in managed woodland in eastern England, we
   examined species and guild responses to vegetation growth and its
   modification by deer herbivory, contrasting winter and the breeding
   season over 4years. Species and guild responses, in terms of seasonal
   presence recorded by multiple point counts, were examined using
   generalized linear mixed models. Several guilds or migrant species
   responded positively to deer exclusion and none responded negatively.
   The shrub-layer foraging guild was recorded less frequently in older and
   browsed vegetation, in both winter and spring. Exclusion of deer also
   increased the occurrence of ground-foraging species in both seasons,
   although these species showed no strong response to vegetation age. The
   canopy-foraging guild was unaffected by deer exclusion or vegetation age
   in either season. There was seasonal variation in the responses of some
   individual resident species, including a significantly lower occurrence
   of Eurasian Wren Troglodytes troglodytes and European Robin Erithacus
   rubecula in browsed vegetation in winter, but no effect of browsing on
   those species in spring. Ordinations of bird assemblage compositions
   also revealed seasonal differences in response to gradients of
   vegetation structure generated by canopy-closure and exclusion of deer.
   Positive impacts of deer exclusion in winter are probably linked to
   reduced thermal cover and predator protection afforded by browsed
   vegetation, whereas species that responded positively in spring were
   also dependent on a dense understorey for nesting. The effects on birds
   of vegetation development and its modification by herbivores extend
   beyond breeding assemblages, with different mechanisms implicated and
   different species affected in winter.},

Title = {Application of termite nest for adsorption of Cr(VI)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {216-223},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {This work proposes the use of tree termite nest as an adsorbent for the
   reduction/removal of Cr(VI) present in aqueous solution. In laboratory
   experiments, adsorption of Cr(VI) was sensitive to pH in the range
   investigated (2-5), with maximum adsorption capacity achieved at pH 2
   (3.70 +/- 0.04 mg g(-1), representing 93.2\% removal of Cr). The termite
   nest was characterized by off-line pyrolysis GC/MS (py-GC/MS), infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
   (EPR). Pyrolysis of the adsorbent produced a complex mixture of aromatic
   compounds, including the guaiacyl and syringilic derivatives that are
   characteristic of lignocellulosic materials. Infrared spectroscopy
   revealed deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group of the biomass with
   increasing pH, which was associated with a decrease in the capacity for
   adsorption of Cr(VI). The EPR g-factor for the termite nest samples
   varied between 2.0037 and 2.0038, indicating the presence of organic
   free radicals that were responsible for the redox reaction. A second
   line with g-factor values of 1.9790, only observed for the samples after
   contact with Cr(VI) solutions at different pH values, was assigned to
   Cr(III)-Cr(III) exchange coupled pairs, which explained the capacity of
   the adsorbent to retain a large portion of the Cr(III) ions produced
   after reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Fixed-bed column experiments
   showed that the termite nest had a maximum adsorption capacity of 18.60
   mg Cr g(-1), an adsorption efficiency varying between 60.8 and 97.4\%,
   and a desorption efficiency varying between 54.5 and 91.4\%, for three
   successive cycles. The adsorbent presented excellent performance in the
   removal of chromium under acidic conditions, with the advantage that it
   could be regenerated and reused. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {High-dimensional nested analysis of variance to assess the effect of
   production season, quality grade and steam pasteurization on the

Abstract = {A nested analysis of variance combined with simultaneous component
   analysis, ASCA, was proposed to model high-dimensional chromatographic
   data. The data were obtained from an experiment designed to investigate
   the effect of production season, quality grade and post-production
   processing (steam pasteurization) on the phenolic content of the
   infusion of the popular herbal tea, rooibos, at `cup-of-tea' strength.
   Specifically, a four-way analysis of variance where the experimental
   design involves nesting in two of the three crossed factors was
   considered.
   For the purpose of the study, batches of fermented rooibos plant
   material were sampled from each of four quality grades during three
   production seasons (2009, 2010 and 2011) and a sub-sample of each batch
   was steam-pasteurized. The phenolic content of each rooibos infusion was
   characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode
   array detection (DAD). In contrast to previous studies, the complete
   HPLC-DAD signals were used in the chemometric analysis in order to take
   into account the entire phenolic profile.
   All factors had a significant effect on the phenolic content of a
   `cup-of-tea' strength rooibos infusion. In particular, infusions
   prepared from the grade A (highest quality) samples contained a higher
   content of almost all phenolic compounds than the lower quality plant
   material. The variations of the content of isoorientin and orientin in
   the different quality grade infusions over production seasons are larger
   than the variations in the content of aspalathin and
   quercetin-3-O-robinobioside. Ferulic acid can be used as an indicator of
   the quality of rooibos tea as its content generally decreases with
   increasing tea quality. Steam pasteurization decreased the content of
   the majority of phenolic compounds in a `cup-of-tea' strength rooibos
   infusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Differential preference for ultraviolet light among captive birds from
   three ecological habitats},

Abstract = {With receptors for red, blue, green, and ultraviolet-A light, birds have
   tetrachromatic vision. For birds, ultraviolet (UV) light is important
   for a number of their behaviors, including mate selection, foraging, and
   nesting. Many captive birds, however, are housed indoors without access
   to natural light and without UV-supplemented lighting; a practice which
   may negatively impact their welfare. Understanding how birds use UV
   light, and assessing its relative importance, is necessary to provide
   optimal care in captive settings. Accordingly, we tested the preference
   for UV light shown by 67 birds housed at Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, USA,
   and its impact on their behavior. We tested 18 species which represented
   three natural ecologies typified by different natural light levels: high
   light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in savannas or seashores), patchy
   light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in forested areas), and
   circumpolar dwellers (e.g., birds that live near the poles). Experiment
   1 investigated the birds' lighting preferences through simultaneous
   presentation of areas of their exhibit lit with supplemental ultraviolet
   light (UV+ zone) and with standard artificial light. Experiment 2
   investigated the impact of supplemental UV light on these birds'
   behavioral repertoire. Birds from high light and circumpolar
   environments showed a preference for the side of their enclosure to
   which UV light was added. High light birds were recorded in the UV+ zone
   during 64\% trials and, similarly, circumpolar birds were observed in
   this UV+ zone for 61\% of trials; a significant preference for UV+ zone,
   P < 0.001 for both. Perhaps mimicking their natural habitat of part-sun
   and part-shade, in Experiment 1 birds from patchy light environments
   split their time evenly within their enclosure (they were recorded in
   the UV+ zone for 54\% of trials). When in an environment with added UV
   light, birds from patchy light habitats were more sociable: the
   percentage of their observation trials spent in proximity and in contact
   with other birds increased from 5\% to 11\% (P = 0.026). Although
   certain birds showed a preference for the added UV light, none showed
   changes in their behavioral repertoire beyond the sociability measure.
   We discuss this preference for UV-supplemented environments and the
   management implications for zoos and other captive facilities which
   house birds indoors. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To explain the evolution of egg colouration in open cup nesting species,
   a number of functions have been suggested. Recent studies focus on the
   role of eggshell colour as a postmating sexually selected trait of
   females which manipulates male parental investment. A basic prediction
   of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In
   this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell
   colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers.
   This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with
   brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters
   describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at
   the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from
   colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg
   of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality,
   females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological
   and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood
   sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and
   Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites
   (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears
   to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects
   concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg
   colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results
   further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on
   the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only
   relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and
   egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component. We discuss reasons
   for the absence of a relationship between egg colouration and female
   quality.},

Abstract = {Modern people usually situate inside buildings, therefore indoor air
   quality (IAQ) is important to living environment. In this research, we
   measured the transpiration rate of 50 experimental plants first, and
   then we chose Bird's-Nest Fern (Asplenium nidus) as experimental subject
   to measure CO2 adsorption, which was one of the common indoor plants
   with high transpiration rate in Taiwan. We constructed an indoor 189
   pots green-wall of Bird's-Nest Fern. CO2 adsorption was measured
   continuously before, during and after the experiment. The experiment
   consisted of three tests, A: Without plants (day time), B: With plants
   (day time), C: With plants (with light, night). Three measurements were
   compared between different tests from A to C. The result of the
   experiment indicated that the density of CO2 was reduced from 2000 to
   600 ppm in 5.37 hours of test C. In average, the efficiency of CO2
   adsorption was 1.38ppm/hr each plant. The indoor temperature decreased
   to 2.5 degrees C and relative humidity increased about 2 similar to 4\%.
   We concluded that Bird's-Nest Fern had superior properties to CO2
   adsorption, temperature and humidity conditioning to indoor air quality

Title = {Nest success and cause-specific nest failure of grassland passerines
   breeding in prairie grazed by livestock},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Livestock grazing is a widespread source of habitat modification, and
   may affect populations of ground-nesting grassland birds by influencing
   rates of nest failure. Nesting attempts can fail for various reasons,
   and determining risk of failure from specific causes associated with
   livestock grazing would enhance development of range management
   practices in areas managed for threatened grassland bird populations.
   Domestic livestock may influence nest failure by affecting vegetation
   structure, numerical or functional responses of predators, or directly
   by trampling nests. We hypothesized stocking rate may influence nest
   fate because it affects the amount and distribution of remaining
   vegetation, and the number of large herbivores to which nests are
   exposed. In 2007 and 2008, we evaluated nest fates for savannah sparrows
   and horned larks under 4 stocking rates experimentally applied in 40-ha
   paddocks in northeastern Oregon, USA. In addition to stocking rate, we
   evaluated variables such as vegetation structure and predator abundance
   and activity to help clarify mechanisms responsible for nest failure. We
   used a discrete competing risks framework to estimate daily probability
   of nest survival and failure from specific causes. These algorithms,
   implemented in a stand-alone graphical user interface-driven model,
   allow incorporation of covariates within an information theoretic
   approach to model inference. Although stocking rate influenced
   vegetation structure, the only nest failures related to stocking rate
   were from trampling. Trampling events were too infrequent to test for
   treatment effects (only 1 nest of each species), but occurred in the
   moderate and high stocking treatments. Additional variables were related
   to variation in nest failure from predation, but we found no support for
   the hypothesis that these causes of failure were affected by stocking
   rate. For savannah sparrows, daily probability of nest success (95\%
   CI)?=?0.97 (0.960.98); predation?=?0.018 (0.0080.028); and
   trampling?=?0.001 (0.0000.004). For horned larks, daily probability of
   nest success?=?0.96 (0.950.98); predation?=?0.029 (0.0120.045); and
   trampling?=?0.003 (0.0000.007). Our results suggest grasslands managed
   for livestock may generally be compatible with grassland songbird
   conservation, at least for the species and stocking rates examined here.
   The most effective conservation strategies for improving nest success
   will involve decreasing risk of nest predation. However, we found no
   evidence that management of stocking rate is an effective method for
   doing so. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

Title = {Public goods, public services and by-product mutualism in an ant-fern
   symbiosis},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {121},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1279-1286},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mutualism can evolve when organisms make novel connections that happen
   to benefit all parties. When such connections involve a host that
   provides a public good for multiple visitor species, selection for
   reciprocal cooperation is only likely if the host has the power to
   preferentially increase the fitness of those visitors that provide a
   better quality service. In contrast, when interactions form between
   multiple visitors and a host that lacks the power to partition the
   public good, we predict that interactions are likely to persist only as
   by-product mutualisms, in which symbiosis benefits both host and
   visitor, but in which neither partner makes costly investments. Focusing
   on the symbiosis between ants and litter trapping epiphytes in the
   canopy of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Borneo, we show that at
   least 71 ant species share the public good of housing within the
   root-mass of epiphytic bird's nest ferns (Asplenium spp.). Ferns
   supporting a higher biomass of ants experienced less herbivory, and
   experimental exclusions of ants from fronds confirmed that this is
   caused by the ants protecting the ferns from herbivores. These results
   establish that there are clear by-product benefits for both parties of
   housing for ants and protection for ferns. If these benefits were to
   drive selection for reciprocal cooperation, we would expect larger ferns
   to support ant colonies that were larger or colonies that produce more
   reproductive individuals. This was not the case. Larger ferns instead
   supported more ant colonies, indicating that the housing provided by the
   fern is a public good that is not restricted to better cooperating ant
   species. Mutualism via novel connections is thus unlikely to evolve
   between a host and multiple partners, even if there are clear by-product
   benefits to all parties, unless the host can direct benefits to
   cooperators.},

Abstract = {Shrubs, such as mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and cholla (Opuntia spp.), now

   Responses of birds to prescribed burning of the shortgrass prairie in

   nests in an experimental landscape (4,811 ha) of spatially replicated,

   Amarillo, Texas. Herbaceous habitat structure was most developed in
   infrequently burned plots, but shrub densities were less variable among
   the burn treatments. We modeled daily nest survival (DSR) against burn
   frequency, shrub density at nest sites, and nest stage (incubation or
   nestling). Daily survival of mourning dove nests was not well-related to
   any measured covariate, but lark sparrow DSR was negatively related to
   the duration of inter-annual burn frequency. In semiarid grasslands

Title = {Interacting effects of aromatic plants and female age on nest-dwelling

Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Pages = {246-253},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Some avian species incorporate aromatic plants to their nests. The
   ``nest protection hypothesis{''}, which posits that volatile secondary
   compounds contained in these plants may have antiparasite properties,
   has not received full support. All previous tests of this hypothesis
   have only considered effects on nest-dwelling ectoparasites, but not on
   blood-sucking flies. The ``drug hypothesis{''} posits that aromatic
   plants may stimulate nestling immune system, development, or condition.
   We tested these hypotheses experimentally in wild blue tits Cyanistes
   caeruleus. a species that adds aromatic plants to their nests. We
   supplemented aromatic plants to half of a sample of nests, while adding
   grass to the other half of nests. We quantified abundance of two groups
   of blood-sucking flies (blackflies and biting midges) at two different
   stages of the reproductive period, and abundance of three nest-dwelling
   ectoparasites (fleas, mites, and blowflies). Experimental
   supplementation of aromatic plants reduced abundance of fleas only in
   nests of yearling females and not in nests of older females. Blackflies
   and biting midges were both more numerous in nests of yearling females
   than in nests of older females. Mass of aromatic plants added by females
   was negatively related with abundance of fleas in control nests but not
   in experimental nests supplied with aromatic plants. Mass of plants
   added by females was also positively related with abundance of
   blackflies during the nestling stage. Finally, aromatic plants did not
   affect nestling growth or immune responses. We conclude that several
   factors such as female experience and their ability to add plants to the
   nest interact to explain effects of aromatic plants on different
   parasites. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Attractive blue-green egg coloration and cuckoo-host coevolution},

Volume = {106},
Number = {1},
Pages = {154-168},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that blue-green coloration of bird eggshells
   may be related to female and/or egg phenotypic quality, and that such
   colour may affect parental effort and therefore the nutritional
   environment of developing nestlings. Here we suggest that these
   relationships and the signal function of eggshell coloration would
   affect the outcome of coevolution between avian brood parasites and
   their hosts in at least three different non-exclusive evolutionary
   pathways. First, by laying blue-green coloured eggs, cuckoo females may
   exploit possible sensory biases of their hosts, constraining the
   evolution of parasitic egg recognition, and thus avoid rejection.
   Second, because of the relatively high costs of laying blue eggs, cuckoo
   females may be limited in their ability to mimic costly blue-green eggs
   of their hosts because cuckoo females lay many more eggs than their
   hosts. Furthermore, costs associated with foreign egg recognition errors
   would be relatively higher for hosts laying blue eggs. Third, cuckoos
   may use coloration of host eggs for selecting individuals or specific
   hosts of appropriate phenotypic quality (i.e. parental abilities). We
   here explored some predictions emerging from the above scenarios and
   found partial support for two of them by studying egg coloration of
   European cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and that of their 25 main hosts, as
   well as parasitism and rejection rate of hosts. Cuckoo hosts parasitized
   with more blue, green, and ultraviolet cuckoo eggs, or those laying more
   blue-green eggs, were more prone to accept experimental parasitism with
   artificial cuckoo eggs. In addition, coloration of cuckoo eggs is more
   variable when parasitizing hosts laying bluer-greener eggs, even after
   controlling for the effect of host egg coloration (i.e. degree of egg
   matching). Globally, our results are consistent with the proposed
   hypothesis that host egg traits that are related to phenotypic quality
   of hosts, such as egg coloration, may have important implications for
   the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and brood parasites. (c)

Abstract = {The contribution of climate change to declining populations of organisms
   remains a question of outstanding concern(1-3). Much attention to
   declining populations has focused on how changing climate drives
   phenological mismatches between animals and their food(4-6). Effects of
   climate on plant communities may provide an alternative, but
   particularly powerful, influence on animal populations because plants
   provide their habitats. Here, we show that abundances of deciduous trees
   and associated songbirds have declined with decreasing snowfall over 22
   years of study in montane Arizona, USA. We experimentally tested the
   hypothesis that declining snowfall indirectly influences plants and
   associated birds by allowing greater over-winter herbivory by elk
   (Cervus canadensis). We excluded elk from one of two paired snowmelt
   drainages (10 ha per drainage), and replicated this paired experiment
   across three distant canyons. Over six years, we reversed multi-decade
   declines in plant and bird populations by experimentally inhibiting
   heavy winter herbivory associated with declining snowfall. Moreover,
   predation rates on songbird nests decreased in exclosures, despite
   higher abundances of nest predators, demonstrating the over-riding
   importance of habitat quality to avian recruitment. Thus, our results
   suggest that climate impacts on plant-animal interactions can have
   forceful ramifying effects on plants, birds, and ecological
   interactions.},

Abstract = {Learned birdsong is a widely used animal model for understanding the
   acquisition of human speech. Male songbirds often learn songs from adult
   males during sensitive periods early in life, and sing to attract mates
   and defend territories. In presumably all of the 350+ parrot species,
   individuals of both sexes commonly learn vocal signals throughout life
   to satisfy a wide variety of social functions. Despite intriguing
   parallels with humans, there have been no experimental studies
   demonstrating learned vocal production in wild parrots. We studied
   contact call learning in video-rigged nests of a well-known marked
   population of green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela.
   Both sexes of naive nestlings developed individually unique contact
   calls in the nest, and we demonstrate experimentally that signature
   attributes are learned from both primary care-givers. This represents
   the first experimental evidence for the mechanisms underlying the
   transmission of a socially acquired trait in a wild parrot population.},

Abstract = {Modern people usually situate inside buildings, therefore indoor air
   quality (IAQ) is important to living environment. Formaldehyde (HCHO)
   has been listed as carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research
   on Cancer). But furnishing material and furniture usually contain large
   amount of formaldehyde. When formaldehyde emission reaches 0.08ppm will
   makes people feel uncomfortable. In this research, we choose Bird's-Nest
   Fern (Asplenium nidus Linn), which is one of the common indoor plants in
   Taiwan, as experimental subject. We constructed an indoor green-wall of
   189 pots which add up to L:360xW:360xH:300cm. The experiment consists of
   three tests, A: No plant (day time), B: plant (day time), C: plant (with
   light, night). Formaldehyde adsorption was measured continuously before,
   during and after the experiment. Temperature and humidity, the rate of
   transpiration rate of Bird's-Nest Fern were observed for 6 hours on each
   of the 2 days. Three measurements were compared between different tests
   from A to C. The result of the experiment indicates that the density of
   formaldehyde was reduced from 2ppm to 0.1 in 3 hours of test B and C. In
   average, the efficiency of formaldehyde adsorption is 0.003ppm each
   plant. The indoor temperature decreases to 2.5 degrees C and relative
   humidity increases about 2 similar to 4\%. The 48 average transpiration
   rate of 78 mmol/(m(2){*}s). We can conclude that Bird's-Nest Fern has
   superior properties to formaldehyde adsorption, temperature and humidity
   conditioning to indoor air quality improvement.},

Abstract = {Many hosts of avian brood parasites such as the common cuckoo (Cuculus
   canorus) show refined egg discrimination behaviour. Egg recognition in
   most open-nesting hosts seems to be based entirely on differences in
   colour. However, hole- and dome-nesting hosts may rely largely on
   luminance contrasts. Here, we studied egg rejection behaviour in
   nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos), an open-nesting species that nests
   in deeply shadowed positions and lays very specific dark olive-green
   eggs. Although being theoretically suitable as hosts of the cuckoo,
   nightingales are very rarely parasitized and no cuckoo egg morph
   mimicking nightingale eggs is known. Thus, we predicted high rejection
   rate of foreign eggs, but because of the dim nesting environments,
   luminance contrasts would be an important cue in egg rejection
   decisions, similar to cavity- or dome-nesting species. We experimentally
   parasitized nightingale nests with two groups of model egg types: bright
   eggs and dark eggs. Within each group, one of the egg types was an
   effective match while the other type was a poor colour match (whitish
   vs. pale blue and olive-green vs. black).We used a discrimination visual
   model to quantify host-model egg similarity and compared egg rejection
   predicted by the model with the observed rejection pattern. Consistent
   with a scenario of largely luminance-based egg recognition, blue and
   white eggs, which had larger achromatic mismatching, were rejected at a
   higher relative rate than the better achromatic matching black and green
   eggs. Nightingales showed strong aggression to a cuckoo dummy,
   suggesting that they were involved in coevolutionary interactions with
   the cuckoo in the past. However, because of the highly distinct
   appearance of nightingale eggs relative to the other sympatrically
   breeding passerines, and the largely luminance-based egg recognition,
   this arms race was likely terminated at an early stage.},

Abstract = {It has been proposed that the blue-green bird egg colourations of many
   avian species may constitute a sexually selected female signal that
   males can use to modulate their parental investment. A fundamental
   untested assumption for the validation of this hypothesis is that males
   can accurately assess differences in the colour of eggs. A recent review
   suggests that this could be particularly problematic when egg clutches
   were located within a dimly lit nest cavity, due to limitations of the
   visual system in low light conditions. Here, we first used a
   photoreceptor noise-limited model of colour discrimination ability that
   accounts for visual performance under low light conditions to study
   whether a typical cavity-nesting passerine, the spotless starling
   Sturnus unicolor, can discriminate their eggs under the ambient
   illumination in their nest-holes. Secondly, we tested the validity of
   model predictions with behavioural data collected in two egg
   discrimination experiments performed in this species. Estimated egg
   detectability depended entirely on model assumptions about visual
   limitations linked to light intensity. Starlings would not be able to
   discriminate egg differences in their nests if the model was based on
   the assumption that light intensity limited detectability, whereas they
   could potentially perceive as different many possible pairwise clutch
   comparisons if the model assumption was that light intensity did not
   limit detectability. Results of behavioural experiments fitted the
   prediction of the visual model where light intensity did not limit
   detectability. Our results suggest that photoreceptor noise-limited
   colour models based on stimulation of single photoreceptors cannot, at
   present, be used to predict egg discrimination ability in spotless
   starlings under low light conditions. Future studies aiming to test egg
   discrimination constraints in the frame of the sexual selection
   hypothesis should therefore combine both modelling and behavioural
   experiments to determine which are the components of the models that
   produce the mismatch with the behavioural conditions.},

Abstract = {Whether learning plays a role in nest building in birds is largely
   unknown. Here we investigated whether the colour of nest materials used
   to build a first nest affected the subsequent nest material choices made
   by male zebra finches when building a second nest. Males were tested for
   their preference for green or brown nest material and then were provided
   with either their preferred or nonpreferred colour with which to build
   their first nest. The success of this nesting attempt was manipulated
   such that half of the breeding pairs had their eggs removed, while the
   other half were allowed to keep their eggs and fledge chicks. Males were
   then retested to determine which colour of nest material they now
   preferred. Males had strong initial preferences for one or other of the
   two colours of nest material. Males that built a nest with their
   preferred colour of nest material continued to prefer that colour after
   nesting, regardless of their breeding success in that nest. However, of
   the males that built a nest with material of their nonpreferred colour,
   those that raised and fledged chicks from it subsequently preferred that
   colour of material for their second nest, while males that suffered a
   failed breeding attempt did not. Thus breeding experience can influence
   decisions relating to nest material choice in nest construction in the

Abstract = {A recent hypothesis suggests that birds' blue-green egg colors may be a
   sexually selected signal of female (and potentially nestling) quality
   that males use to make parental investment decisions. While there is
   some empirical support for this idea, both theory and observations
   question its validity. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we
   examined the influence of egg color on male American robin Turdus
   migratorius behavior by replacing natural clutches with four artificial
   eggs that were all either pale or vividly colored, close to the extremes
   in natural egg coloration. At the end of the incubation period, three
   unrelated nestlings were fostered into each experimental nest, and
   parental provisioning behavior was monitored when nestlings were 3, 6,
   and 9 days old. Male provisioning rate for 3-day-old nestlings was
   significantly higher in the vivid egg treatment compared to both the
   pale egg treatment and untreated controls, but there was no effect of
   egg color on paternal behavior at the older nestling stages. Male
   feeding rate at unmanipulated nests was only weakly positively related
   to natural egg color (chroma) when nestlings were 3 days old. These
   results suggest that blue-green egg color may act as a post-mating
   signal of female quality or investment in this species, but our findings
   do not exclude the possibility that egg color pigmentation also serves
   other adaptive functions.},

Abstract = {Results and critical standpoints regarding the actions of the feral
   pigeon (Columba livia) population management in Ljubljana were studied.
   The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of the methods
   used to manage and control the feral pigeon population in Ljubljana. The
   effectiveness of progesterone, ultrasound deterrent and artificial
   dovecots for egg collection was tested in order to evaluate different
   approaches to feral pigeon population management in Ljubljana. The most
   effective method of pigeon control was the use of contraceptives, since
   the number of pigeons in selected locations of the wider centre of
   Ljubljana decreased by 49.1\% (P>0.05) in the period from 1999 to 2004.
   The method of ultrasound as a pigeon deterrent remains questionable,
   since no distinctive deterrent effects were established, even though
   pigeons in our experiment showed significant (P<0.001) signs of
   agitation when ultrasound was present in the tested area of the covered
   passage entrance to the urban landfill in Ljubljana. The method of
   pigeon nesting in 8 green plot and 2 house attic artificial dovecots,
   which we are investigating at present, seems to have great potential
   regarding the egg collecting and consequently the reduction of the
   number of feral pigeons, improving nesting hygiene and hobby feeding
   control. After a 10-month period, since the green plot dovecots were
   built, pigeons have already started to nest in 62\% of the available
   nesting space, however eggs will not be collected until the dovecots are
   populated completely. The house attic dovecotes were only built
   recently, so they were still un-populated at the end of this study. We
   concluded that all the methods used may be only successful in the long
   term by implementing an integrated approach to pigeon control, specially
   supported by public information and education.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {148},
Number = {11-13},
Pages = {1359-1375},
Abstract = {The carrying of feathers to adorn the nest has been recently described
   as a female behaviour that indicates quality in a passerine bird - the
   spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) -, but the consequences that the
   variability of this trait may have on breeding success are still
   unknown. The feather-carrying behaviour is a sexual behaviour that is
   performed in response to a male display: the carrying of green plants.
   In this paper we explore whether foreign feathers affect male investment
   on chick rearing or reinforce the pair mating bonds. The experimental
   addition of feathers to nests caused an increase in clutch size and a
   reduction of nestling mortality, although it did not affect feeding
   rates or the removal of faecal sacs by males or females. Nest feathers
   did not increase the frequency with which females laid a second clutch
   in the same nest and with the same male. Thus, our results do not
   support the sexual selection hypothesis for the evolution of the
   carrying feathers behaviour. An alternative hypothesis that deserves to
   be addressed in specifically designed studies is that foreign feathers
   may be taken to nests as a sort of chemical warfare against nest
   parasites. The sexual selection and the chemical defence hypotheses are,
   however, not mutually exclusive and future research should evaluate
   whether the pre-existence of a behavioural trait arising by natural
   selection may drive the evolution of a signalling trait.},

   Habitat variables, including height above ground, vegetation level,
   vegetation density at locations where these three types of behavior
   occurred, and structure, height and diameter at breast height (dbh) of
   the plant used were recorded from March to July of 2002. The
   Gray-checked Fulvetta predominantly nested in bushes and among herbs
   (86.7\%), but usually foraged and sang in trees (70.8\% and 78.3\%,
   respectively). Consequently, significant differences were found in the
   structure of plants and vegetation level used among nesting, foraging,
   and singing behavior. Gray-checked Fulvettas built their nests at an
   average height of 1.05 m; however, they foraged around 3.75 m and sang
   at 5.30 m above ground. On the other hand, nests were situated within
   the most concealed area, with an average vegetation density of 74\%,
   significantly greater than those of the foraging and singing sites
   (45\%, 38\%, respectively). The differential use of microhabitat among
   these three types of behavior strongly exhibits the divergent adaptation
   of different behaviors to a bird's environment. This is the first report
   on habitat selection of various behaviors of the Gray-checked Fulvetta,

Volume = {100},
Number = {4},
Pages = {753-762},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Recent work suggests that the evolution of egg coloration may have been
   constrained in three important ways that have not yet been critically
   synthesized in any review. First, on account of birds being able to see
   in the ultraviolet spectrum, the interaction between the properties of
   avian vision and the light environment of nests imply different
   perceptions of egg coloration from those experienced by humans. Second,
   a new hypothesis to explain blue green egg coloration interprets it as a
   sexually selected signal to males of the laying female's genetic
   quality. Third, evidence from taxa as divergent as sparrowhawks and
   great tits indicates that protoporphyrin pigments responsible for
   maculation (spotting patterns) have a structural function in
   compensating for eggshell thinning, as caused by calcium stress, and,
   more recently, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. We consider this to be
   the most convincing explanation for the primary function of spotting,
   although an important secondary function might arise through the fact
   that individual patterns of maculation may allow birds to identify their
   own eggs, effectively serving as signatures in the face of inter- or
   intra-specific brood parasitism. These constraints or hypotheses are not
   mutually exclusive, and should not be taken to imply that one, but not
   other, agents of selection might apply to any one species. However, the
   sexually-selected eggshell coloration hypothesis is least plausible for
   hole-nesting birds because of the poor light quality available, although
   such species have been the focus of research in this area, and only a
   single experimental study has shown a link between egg coloration and
   male provisioning. Furthermore, the observed relationships between
   female phenotypic quality and egg traits do not necessarily imply that
   they have signalling functions. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

   Chelonia mydas nest year round at the Ras Al Hadd Nature Reserve, Oman,
   with a distinct lower-density nesting season from Oct. to May, and a
   higher-density nesting season from June to Sept. On these beaches, the
   main predators of turtle eggs and hatchlings are foxes Vulpes spp.,
   wolves Canis lupus arabs, and wild cats Felis spp. and Caracal caracal
   schmitzi. During 1999-2001, both the nesting behavior of these turtles
   and the diets of foxes (the main predator on the beaches) were
   investigated, and we tested whether female turtles were able to
   avoid/reduce predation pressure on their eggs and hatchlings on the
   nesting grounds. Elsewhere in the region and globally, foxes are known
   to feed on rodents, lizards, birds, and insects, but at Ras Al Hadd,
   their diet is basically composed of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings
   (comprising about 95\% in volume), with smaller contributions from other
   marine invertebrates (mostly ghost crabs Ocypode spp. and large
   gastropods), although they also sporadically ingested birds and lizards.
   The ability to adapt to a diet of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, on
   these beaches, is certainly a factor behind the success of this
   carnivore community in the arid lands of the Arabian Peninsula. Field
   experiments indicated that nesting sea turtles recognized both natural
   predators and humans as threats to their offspring, and this was
   reflected in modifications to their nesting behavior. In relatively
   undisturbed areas (by both natural predators and humans), sea turtle
   nest density was significantly higher, and nests were placed further
   away from the surf's edge, in contrast to results from relatively
   disturbed areas, where turtle nests were closer to the surf's edge, thus
   reducing the distance hatchlings had to travel when they emerge and
   begin their journey to the sea. Nesting turtles interrupted their
   nesting cycle if they sensed the presence of people or foxes, returning
   to the sea without laying a clutch. However, if they had already
   initiated oviposition when they sensed the presence of people and/or
   predators, they continued, although they significantly increased efforts
   to camouflage their nests. Other reasons behind nest site abandonment
   included sand collapsing events (critical during preparation of the egg
   chamber) and intraspecific competition for nest sites. These behavioral
   patterns of sea turtles result from their evolutionary adaptation to
   nesting on beaches, which surely played a role in their survival, but
   also highlight the importance of minimizing human disturbance and
   activities on turtle nesting beaches.

Title = {Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal in a neotropical
   savanna},

Abstract = {P>1. A substantial portion of the crop of fruiting trees falls beneath
   parent plants as a result of dispersal failure. Such diaspores are
   considered as waste because the likelihood of plant recruitment is
   usually very small close to parent trees. However, many animals may
   rescue fallen diaspores and provide them with another chance of
   dispersal and establishment.
   2. We investigated the effectiveness of two broad types of seed
   dispersal vectors for the regeneration of Xylopia aromatica in the
   Brazilian cerrado savanna: birds that remove diaspores from plant
   canopies and ants that harvest diaspores on the ground under the parent
   plant (as rescuers) or from bird feces (as secondary dispersers).
   3. Birds removed a mean of 32\% of the crop from plant canopies, but
   removal was independent of crop size. A large part of the crop (mean of
   25\%) landed beneath parent plants or was dropped after manipulation by
   vertebrate frugivores as viable diaspores. Ants from at least five
   genera removed most fallen diaspores (up to 83\%) within 24 h. Ants
   influenced the fate of a large amount of the crop, and for some trees
   ants removed as many diaspores as birds.
   4. Large ants rescued some diaspores to distances beyond the parent
   plant crown, but birds may remove diaspores 40-fold farther. However,
   seedlings of X. aromatica were only found close to nests of large ants,
   probably due to diaspore rescuing and/or directed secondary dispersal by
   certain ant groups following primary dispersal by birds. Although an
   unknown percentage of seeds was lost to granivorous ants, diaspore
   removal by ants potentially enhances the likelihood of plant recruitment
   due to distance-related benefits and directed dispersal to ant nests,
   while birds play a premier role in long-distance seed dispersal and
   metapopulation dynamics.
   5. Synthesis. Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal at
   different spatial scales to X. aromatica. Since ants remove most fallen
   diaspores beneath parent plants, the use of diaspore removal rates from
   plant canopy as a surrogate of plant fitness may be misleading. By
   acting as secondary dispersers, ants may also provide a fine-tuned
   dispersal following long-distance dispersal by birds (i.e. diplochory).},

Abstract = {Declines in northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite)
   populations in the southeastern United States may be partially
   attributable to loss of early successional plant cover associated with
   greater use of herbicides in forest management. We tested effects of 5
   levels of operational plantation establishment intensity on vegetation
   communities and structure important for bobwhite in 1-5-year-old
   loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations (n = 4) in the Outer Coastal
   Plain Mixed Forest of Mississippi. We compared results with values
   reported in the literature to calculate usable space for winter food,
   loafing, nesting, and brood-rearing at 2 levels of spatial resolution.
   Treatments (k = 5) reflected a range of management intensities and were
   combinations of mechanical site preparation, chemical site preparation
   (CSP), and herbaceous weed control (HWC). Coverage of winter food plants
   in the least intensive treatment was more than double that in the most
   intensive; however, differences in usable space of winter food cover
   were negligible due to improved accessibility in more intensive
   treatments. Although CSP reduced coverage of nonpine woody plants across
   all years, loafing cover reached adequate levels by year 3 in all
   treatments. Usable nesting cover was <4\% across all years and
   treatments and was nearly eliminated by the reduction in herbaceous
   cover and visual screening cover following broadcast HWC. Optimal
   brood-rearing habitat was virtually absent in all treatments and years
   due to the lack of conjoint occurrence of bare ground and forb canopy.
   Although bobwhite habitat may have been promoted by formerly widespread
   plantation establishment methods that involved wide-scale soil
   disturbance, those established using newer methods with less soil
   disturbance are likely inadequate for most bobwhite habitat
   requirements. Efforts to provide bobwhite habitat in
   plantation-dominated landscapes may have to rely on management of
   thinned mid-rotation stands and permanent landscape features such as
   rights-of-way. The value of young plantations for bobwhite may be
   increased by reducing management intensity or increasing spacing between
   planting rows, thus increasing time before crown closure and providing
   opportunity for understory manipulations.},

Volume = {97},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {When both parents provide offspring care, equal sharing of costly
   parental duties may enhance reproductive success. This is crucial for
   longlived species, where increased parental effort in current
   reproduction profoundly affects future reproduction. Indication of
   reproductive value or willingness to invest in reproduction may promote
   matching responses by mates, thus reducing the conflict over care. In
   birds with biparental care, blue-green eggshell color may function as a
   signal of reproductive value that affects parental effort, as predicted
   by the signaling hypothesis of blue-green eggshell coloration. However,
   this hypothesis has not been explored during incubation, when the
   potential stimulus of egg color is present, and has been little studied
   in longlived birds. We experimentally studied if egg color affected
   incubation patterns in the blue-footed booby, a longlived species with
   biparental care and blue eggs. We exchanged fresh eggs between nests of
   the same laying date and recorded parental incubation effort on the
   following 4 days. Although egg color did not affect male effort,
   original eggshell color was correlated with pair matching in incubation.
   Exchanged eggshell color did not affect incubation patterns. This
   suggests that biliverdin-based egg coloration reflects female quality
   features that are associated with pair incubation effort or that
   blue-footed boobies mate assortatively high-quality pairs incubating
   more colorful clutches. An intriguing possibility is that egg coloration
   facilitates an equal sharing of incubation, the signal being functional
   only during a short period close to laying. Results also suggest that
   indication of reproductive value reduces the conflict over care.},

Abstract = {Animals frequently use metabolites produced by symbiotic bacteria as
   agents against pathogens and parasites. Secretions from the preen gland
   of birds are used for this purpose, although its chemicals apparently
   are produced by the birds themselves. European hoopoes Upupa epops and
   green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus harbour symbiotic bacteria in
   the uropygial gland that might be partly responsible for the chemical
   composition of secretions. Here we investigate the antimicrobial
   activity of the volatile fraction of chemicals in hoopoe preen
   secretions, and, by means of experimental antibiotic injections, test
   whether symbiotic bacteria living within the uropygial gland are
   responsible for their production. Hoopoes produce two different kinds of
   secretions that differ drastically in their chemical composition. While
   the malodorous dark secretions produced by nestlings included a complex
   mix of volatiles, these chemicals did not appear in white secretions
   produced by non-nesting birds. All volatiles detected showed strong
   antibacterial activity, and a mixture of the chemicals at the
   concentrations measured in nestling glands inhibited the growth of all
   bacterial strains assayed. We found support for the hypothesized role of
   bacteria in the production of such antimicrobial chemicals because
   experimental clearance of bacteria from glands of nestlings with
   antibiotics resulted in secretions without most of the volatiles
   detected in control individuals. Thus, the presence of symbiotic
   bacteria in the uropygial gland provides hoopoes with potent
   antimicrobials for topical use.},

Abstract = {Several bird species add fresh fragments of plants which are rich in

   understand the mechanisms underlying such benefits, we experimentally
   tested the effects of these plants on the bacteria living on blue tits.
   Aromatic plants significantly affected the structure of bacterial
   communities, in particular reducing bacterial richness on nestlings. In
   addition, in this population where there is a strong association between
   bacterial density and infestation by blood-sucking Protocalliphora blow
   fly larvae, these plants reduced bacterial density on the most infested
   chicks. Aromatic plants had no significant effect on the bacteria living

Abstract = {The uropygial glands of birds serve multiple functions, and there is
   great interspecific variability in the composition and properties of
   their secretions. A special case is the secretion in the hoopoes Upupa
   epops, and green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus, which, contrary to
   the commonly white and odourless secretions, are dark with pungent
   odour. Recently, bacteria have been isolated from glands of both
   woodhoopoes and hoopoes and here we test the hypothesis that bacteria
   are responsible of some of the special properties of glands and
   secretions of this group of birds. We explore natural seasonal changes
   and intersexual differences in the properties of hoopoe glands and
   secretions, check the natural occurrence of bacteria within secretions,
   and analyse the effect of experimental injection of antibiotics on
   uropygial gland properties. Male glands underwent no seasonal changes,
   and their secretions were invariably white and odourless, very similar
   to female glands outside the breeding season. However, in comparison to
   the uropygial gland of non-breeding females, those of incubating females
   showed a marked increase in size and volume of secretion produced, which
   became dark and pungent. All these parameters increased until the
   hatching date and returned to values similar to those in the prelaying
   phase towards the end of the nestling period. Nestling glands produced
   secretions similar to those of females in colour and odour. Gland size
   of both females and nestlings predicted the amount of secretion
   produced. Microscopic techniques confirmed the presence of bacteria at
   high density and in active division in all dark secretions examined. The
   antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the load of enterococci in
   nestling glands, did not affect size of glands, but diminished the
   volume of secretion, which was lighter in colour than that of control
   nestlings. In nesting females, the experimental injection of antibiotic
   affected some measurements of gland size and secretion colour. Because
   the experiment did not affect general health estimates
   (immunocompetence, body condition or growing) of nestlings, our results
   suggest that some of the special properties of hoopoe glands are
   mediated by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.},

Abstract = {For altricial birds, detailed studies of parental care include egg
   incubation, brooding and chick feeding, all of them being crucial to
   offspring survival. Few studies have explored nest building and
   maintenance from this perspective, although the nest is the first
   environment experienced by hatchlings. On Corsica, blue tits, Cyanistes
   caeruleus, incorporate fresh fragments of several species of aromatic
   plants in the nest cup throughout the nesting period, and replenish the
   nest with fresh fragments of the same plant species quickly after
   experimental removal. In this study, we experimentally tested whether
   aromatic plants used by blue tits affect the growth and condition of
   nestlings. Because we expected the effects of plants to depend on
   environmental conditions, we tested this hypothesis both in enlarged and
   in control broods. Aromatic plants positively affected chick mass gain
   in enlarged broods. Chicks in nests containing aromatic plants also had
   higher haematocrit levels. In addition, in 1 of the 2 study years,
   feathers developed faster in aromatic-treated nests than in nests where
   aromatic plants had been replaced by a neutral nest material (moss).
   However, no significant effect of aromatic plants on chick body size at.
   edging was found. We propose several hypotheses on the proximal

Abstract = {1. The majority of general life-history models treat the environment as
   being invariable through time, even though temporal variation in
   selective agents could dramatically change the outcomes, e.g. in terms
   of optimal size and time at maturity. For herbivorous insects, seasonal
   differences in food quality are reasonably well described, but seasonal
   dynamics of top-down selective forces are poorly documented.
   2. The present study attempted to quantify seasonal changes in predation
   risk of folivorous insect larvae in temperate forest habitats. In a
   series of field experiments, artificial larvae were exposed to
   predators, and the resulting bird-inflicted damage was recorded. The
   trials were repeated regularly throughout the course of two summers.
   3. A distinct peak of larval mortality was recorded in mid-June (the
   nestling period for most insectivorous passerine birds), after which
   predation risk declined to a plateau of 20-30\% below the peak value.
   4. The recorded pattern is interpreted as a consequence of seasonal
   changes in the number and behaviour of insectivorous birds, and the
   abundance of alternative food resources for these predators.
   5. A quantitative analysis based on field data indicated that
   considering temporal variation in mortality in life-history models is
   crucial for obtaining realistic predictions concerning central
   life-history traits, such as final body size in different generations.},

   plant species, especially when coincident with propagule supply.
   Following establishment, increased resource availability may also
   facilitate the spread of exotic plant species if it enhances their
   competitive abilities relative to native species. Exotic Canada geese
   (Branta canadensis) introduce both exotic grass seed and nutrients to an
   endangered plant community on the Gulf Islands of southwestern British
   Columbia, Canada. I used greenhouse experiments to assess the
   competitive advantage of the exotic grasses relative to native and
   exotic forbs in this community and to test the impacts of nutrient
   addition from goose feces on competitive outcomes. I grew experimental
   communities varying in their proportion of forbs versus exotic grasses,
   and added goose feces as a nutrient source. I found that both native and
   exotic forbs produced significantly more biomass in competition with
   conspecifics than in competition with the grasses, and that the
   proportional abundance of two out of three native forbs was lowest in
   the combined presence of exotic grasses and nutrient addition. In a
   second experiment, I found that in monoculture all species of forbs and
   grasses showed equal growth responses to nutrients. The exotic species
   did not convert additional nutrients into additional biomass at a higher
   rate, but did germinate earlier and grow larger than the native species
   regardless of nutrient availability. This suggests that the exotic
   species may have achieved their competitive advantage partly by
   pre-empting resources in community mixtures. Small and late-germinating
   native forbs may be particularly vulnerable to competitive suppression
   from exotic grasses and forbs and may be at an even greater disadvantage
   if their competitors are benefiting from early access to additional
   nutrients. In combination, the input of exotic propagules and additional
   nutrients by nesting geese may compromise efforts to maintain native
   community composition in this system.},

Title = {Is the structural and psittacofulvin-based coloration of wild burrowing
   parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus condition dependent?},

Abstract = {The bright colours of parrots are caused by psittacofulvin pigments,
   which appear unique to this Order, and by structural colours. We
   measured red (psittacofulvin), green (mixed) and blue (structural)
   colours of wild burrowing parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus of northeastern
   Patagonia, Argentina, and measured nestlings regularly to obtain data on
   breeding success and nestling growth. As adult feathers are moulted
   outside the breeding season, adult body condition could not be measured
   directly during feather growth, and climatic conditions were used as an
   indirect parameter. The colony of burrowing parrots is surrounded by
   Monte steppe habitat, the breeding success has been shown to depend
   strongly on the climatic patterns. The area experienced a drought with
   very poor breeding success as well as a year of above-average
   precipitation during the study period, serving as a natural experiment.
   We thus analysed the variability of colouration within the population
   among and within breeding seasons. We observed strong inter-annual
   differences in nestling and adult colouration. Nestlings grew blue
   feathers with lower achromatic brightness during better conditions, and
   when controlling for year effects, nestlings with higher mass and from
   more successful families also had blue feathers with lower achromatic
   brightness. Adult blue feathers showed the same trend, with lower
   achromatic brightness in the moult following breeding seasons of better
   conditions. In contrast, during better conditions, adults grew red
   feathers with higher achromatic brightness and the colour hue was also
   affected, and the hue of the red region of nestlings varied with the
   hatching order. The colour of all three regions of nestlings varied
   between nests, and the colour of the red region of adult males
   positively correlated with breeding success (clutch size, brood size).
   In summary, the present data suggest that environmental conditions
   contribute to variability in both structural and the
   psittacofulvin-based colours of wild burrowing parrots.},

Title = {Aromatic plants in blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus nests: no negative
   effect on blood-sucking Protocalliphora blow fly larvae},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nesting birds use several behavioural or physiological defence
   mechanisms against parasites. On Corsica, female blue tits Cyanistes
   caeruleus incorporate fresh fragments of a limited number of aromatic
   plants in the nest cup, from the end of nest construction until
   fledging. Some of these plants negatively affect bacterial growth and
   host location by blood-sucking mosquitoes in laboratory conditions. In
   natural populations, Corsican blue tit chicks are exposed to the highest
   levels of blood-sucking ectoparasitic blow flies Protocalliphora spp.
   reported in Europe. These ectoparasites can have severe negative effects
   on chick development and survival probabilities, especially when food
   constraints are elevated. Here we investigated in several natural
   Corsican blue tit populations the hypothesis that aromatic plants
   brought to the nest have anti-blow fly effects during the chick-rearing
   stage. We predicted that: 1) the amount of aromatic plants should be
   negatively related to blow fly infestation intensity across nests, 2)
   experimental addition of aromatic plants in nests should reduce blow fly
   infestation intensity, and 3) nestlings should be in better physical
   condition in nests where aromatic plants were experimentally added. No
   significant relation was found between amount of aromatic plants in
   nests and blow fly infestation intensity. Experimental addition of
   aromatic plants did not reduce blow fly infestation intensity and did
   not affect the chick phenotypic parameters we measured. We conclude that
   aromatic plants in blue tit nests are not used as a defence against
   ectoparasitic Protocalliphora blow flies in our study population.},

   University {[}J. D. Douglass, J. B. Greenly, D. A. Hammer et al., in

   were alloy 5056 and the 6.25 mu m stainless steel wires were alloy
   SS304. The diagnostic suite included fast-x-ray and extreme ultraviolet
   (EUV) detectors, a time-gated x-ray pinhole camera, x-ray spectrometers,
   and laser shadow imaging. The main focus was made on the spectroscopic
   study of plasma evolution after the main x-ray burst though the data
   from photoconducting detector (PCD) and EUV signals over the whole
   period of current, and in addition laser shadowgraphy images before the
   main x-ray burst were analyzed. Modeling of the time-gated spectra
   recorded after the main x-ray burst indicates that the electron
   temperature Te either follows the PCD signals and peaks at times of the
   second (and the third if present) x-ray burst or has the higher value at
   the first frame (closest to the main x-ray burst), then slightly changes
   and increases at the last frame, which coincides with the second maximum
   of the current. It was also found that the values of Te never drop below
   150 eV, and the EUV signal remains intense even when the PCD signal is
   almost zero. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {171},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-194},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It has been recently proposed that the blue-green coloration in eggs of
   many avian species may constitute a sexually selected female signal.
   Blue-green color intensity would reflect the physiological condition of
   females, and hence it might also affect the allocation of male parental
   care. In this study, we use three different experimental approaches to
   explore the importance of sexual selection on blue-green egg coloration
   of spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) eggs. First, experimental
   deterioration of female body condition (by means of wing feather
   removal) negatively affected the intensity of blue-green egg coloration.
   Second, blue-green color intensity of artificial model eggs had a
   significant positive influence on paternal feeding effort. Finally, we
   found a negative relationship between the effect of experimental food
   supply on nestling immunocompetence and the intensity of blue-green
   coloration of eggs, suggesting that egg color predicts nutritional
   conditions that nestlings will experience during development. All these
   results taken together strongly support a role of sexual selection in
   the blue-green coloration of spotless starling eggs.},

Abstract = {Few Neotropical birds have been the subject of long-term ecological and
   behavioral research. I present highlights from 19 years of studies on
   the Green-rumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus) in the Ilanos of
   Venezuela, based on marking and resighting over 7500 individuals and
   monitoring of 2500 nesting attempts in two populations breeding in nest
   boxes. Initial work focused on the causes and consequences of the
   extreme hatching asynchrony exhibited by parrotlets. Examining an
   exhaustive set of fitness correlates at experimentally synchronized or
   asynchronized nests found no evidence that asynchrony benefited hatching
   patterns. The consequences of not caring for eggs during laying were
   severe, as unincubated eggs lost their viability rapidly and eggs left
   in unguarded nests were frequently destroyed by nonbreeding pairs. Work
   over the past decade has focused on understanding parrotlet social
   system and population dynamics. Parrotlets have a complex social system
   composed of male-female nesting pairs, nonbreeding male-female pairs,
   male-male pairs, and nonbreeding males occurring primarily alone or in
   groups that sometimes molest breeders. Nonbreeders composed up to 50\%
   of the males that are resighted during years when populations are large.
   Extra pair fertilizations were uncommon (< 8\% of young). Divorce rarely
   occurs in breeding pairs, but pairs typically breed together for only
   1-2 years. Male-male pairs were young individuals that traveled
   together, allopreened each other, and entered nest boxes together.
   Parrotlets have strong site fidelity and form two breeding populations
   connected by dispersing juveniles. The two sites are 600 in apart, but
   differ in elevation by 1-2 m, in soil type, and flooding regime. These
   differences can result in differences of up to 6 weeks in the onset of
   nesting in rainy years, but not in dry years. Long-term studies are
   critical to understand the ecology of tropical birds and the effects of
   climate change on them.},

Abstract = {Social life is generally associated with an increased exposure to
   pathogens and parasites, due to factors such as high population density,
   frequent physical contact and the use of perennial nest sites. However,
   sociality also permits the evolution of new collective behavioural
   defences. Wood ants, Formica paralugubris, commonly bring back pieces of
   solidified coniferous resin to their nest. Many birds and a few mammals
   also incorporate green plant material into their nests. Collecting plant
   material rich in volatile compounds might be an efficient way to fight
   bacteria and fungi. However, no study has demonstrated that this
   behaviour has a positive effect on survival. Here, we provide the first
   experimental evidence that animals using plant compounds with
   antibacterial and antifungal properties survive better when exposed to
   detrimental micro-organisms. The presence of resin strongly improves the
   survival of F. paralugubris adults and larvae exposed to the bacteria
   Pseudomonas fluorescens, and the survival of larvae exposed to the
   entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. These results show that
   wood ants capitalize on the chemical defences which have evolved in
   plants to collectively protect themselves against pathogens.},

Abstract = {In this work, two non-cubic equations of state, Perturbed Chain
   Statistical Association Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) and Simplified Perturbed
   Hard Chain Theory (SPHCT) were used to predict critical lines and
   regions for several binary and ternary systems, by fitting one binary
   interaction parameter (K-ij) for each binary system. Results were
   compared with experimental critical data, which included inorganic
   gases, hydrocarbons (light and heavy paraffins, non-saturated olefins
   and aromatics), alcohols, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These
   experimental data covered wide ranges of temperatures and pressures
   which are commonly used in industry. For comparison, the data were also
   modeled using two cubic equations of state: the well-known Peng-Robinson
   equation (PR) and the Patel-Teja-Valderrama equation (PTV). PC-SAFIF and
   SPHCT pure-component parameters were obtained by regression, adjusting
   pure-component data such as vapor pressure and saturated liquid molar
   volume (taken from DIPPR 1.2.0). Excellent results were obtained with
   the PC-SAFT EoS, while the SPHCT, PR and PTV EoS did not have a good
   performance. The Heidemann and Khalil algorithm, with two nested
   single-variable iteration loops (an internal loop for volume and an

Abstract = {We compared the effects of 3 fuel reduction techniques and a control on
   breeding birds during 2001-2005 using 50-m point counts. Four
   experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3
   replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North
   Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical
   understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3)
   mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments
   in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub
   cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls.
   Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn
   treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter
   burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not
   detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species
   richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo
   buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis),
   increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year
   delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after
   treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers
   (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus)
   declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to
   understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most
   species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag
   density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions,
   and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn
   treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species
   richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy
   intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory
   removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the
   mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy
   tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used
   as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open
   habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have
   short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the
   ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.},

Abstract = {Oil sands mining is steadily expanding in Alberta, Canada. Major
   companies are planning reclamation strategies for mine tailings, in

   naphthenic acids during the extraction process. A series of experimental
   wetlands were built on companies' leases to assess the feasibility of
   this approach, and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were designated
   as upper trophic biological sentinels. From May to July 2004, prevalence
   and intensity of infestation with bird blow flies Frotocalliphora spp.
   (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were measured in nests on oil sands reclaimed
   wetlands and compared with those on a reference site. Nestling growth
   and survival also were monitored. Prevalence of infestation was
   surprisingly high for a small cavity nester; 100\% of the 38 nests
   examined were infested. Nests on wetlands containing oil sands waste
   materials harbored on average from 60\% to 72\% more blow fly larvae
   than those on the reference site. Nestlings on reclaimed sites suffered
   mean parasitic burdens about twice that of those on the reference site;
   and for comparable parasitic load, they exhibited greater pathologic
   effects (e.g., decreased body mass) than control nestlings. The heavy
   blow fly infestation on oil sands-impacted wetlands suggests that oil

Abstract = {Impressive variation in egg colouration among birds has puzzled
   evolutionary biologists for a long time. The most frequently studied
   selective forces moulding egg colouration-predation and brood
   parasitism-have either received little empirical support or may play a
   role in only a minority of species. A novel hypothesis has suggested
   that egg colour may be significantly influenced by sexual selection.
   Females may deposit a blue-green pigment biliverdin into eggshells
   instead of using it for themselves as a powerful antioxidant. By this
   handicap, females may signal their quality to males, which are then
   hypothesized to increase their paternal effort. We experimentally tested
   the hypothesis in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a
   species laying blue-green eggs. We cross-fostered clutches between nests
   to disentangle effects of female/territory quality and egg colour on
   paternal effort and nestling quality. The results supported two
   assumptions of sexual signalling through egg colour hypothesis: Blue
   pigment seems to be a limited resource for females, and female quality
   is positively correlated with the intensity of the blue-green colour.
   However, we did not find support for the main prediction of the
   hypothesis, as male parental effort parameters (feeding frequencies to
   nestlings and intensity of nest defence) were unrelated to egg colour.
   We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and
   previous correlative analyses that supported the hypothesis that blue
   egg colour may be a postmating, sexually selected signal in females.},

Title = {Experimental addition of greenery reduces flea loads in nests of a
   non-greenery using species, the tree swallow Tachycineta bicolor},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-12},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Several bird species, including cavity-nesters such as European
   starlings Sturnus vulgaris, add to their nests green sprigs of plants
   such as yarrow Achillea millefolium that are rich in volatile compounds.
   In this field study on another cavity-nester, tree swallows Tachycineta
   bicolor, we tested whether yarrow reduced ectoparasite loads (the nest
   protection hypothesis), stimulated nestling immune systems (the drug
   hypothesis), or had other consequences for nestling growth or parental
   reproductive success (predicted by both preceding hypotheses). Tree
   swallows do not naturally add greenery to their nests, and thus offer
   several advantages in testing for effects of greenery independent of
   other potentially confounding explanations for the behaviour. We placed
   fresh yarrow in 23 swallow nests on the day the first egg was laid,
   replenishing every two days until clutch completion (=three times), and
   at 44 control nests, nesting material was simply touched. At 12 days of
   age, we measured nestling body size and mass, and took blood smears to
   do differential white blood cell counts. We subsequently determined the
   number and proportion of young fledging from nests and the number of
   fleas remaining after fledging. Higher humidity was associated with
   higher flea numbers whereas number of feathers in the nest was not. Our
   most significant finding was that an average of 773 fleas Ceratophyllus
   idius was found in control nests, versus 419 in yarrow nests. Possibly,
   parents compensate for blood that nestlings lose to ectoparasites by
   increasing food delivery, because we detected no differences between
   treatments in nestling mass, nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion
   of young fledging, or relative to flea numbers. Our results provide no
   support for the drug hypothesis and strong support for the nest
   protection hypothesis.},

Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {975-985},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations throughout
   much of their range have been declining. These declines have largely
   been attributed to the loss or deterioration of sagebrush (Artemisia
   spp.) habitat. In response government agencies such as the United States
   Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service are
   cost-sharing on management practices designed to improve habitat
   conditions for sage-grouse. Little is known regarding sage-grouse
   response to various sagebrush management techniques. We studied the
   effects of reducing sagebrush canopy cover using 2 mechanical (Dixie
   harrow and Lawson aerator) treatments and 1 chemical (Tebuthiuron)
   treatment on greater sage-grouse use of brood-rearing habitats on Parker
   Mountain, Utah, USA. To conduct this experiment, we identified 19
   40.5-ha plots that exhibited > 40\% mountain big sagebrush (A.
   tridentata vaseyana) canopy cover and randomly assigned 16 as treatment
   or controls (4 replicates each). Tebuthiuron and Dixie-harrow-treated
   plots had more forb cover than did control plots (P = 0.01 and 0.02,
   respectively) in post-treatment periods. Greater sage-grouse brood use
   was higher in Tebuthiuron than control plots (P = 0.01). We believe this
   was attributed to increased herbaceous cover, particularly forb cover.
   However, in all plots, sage-grouse use was greatest within 10 m of the
   edge of the treatments where adjacent sagebrush cover was still
   available. Although the treatments we studied resulted in the plots
   achieving sage-grouse brooding-rearing habitat guidelines, caution
   should be exercised in applying these observations at lower elevations,
   on sites with less annual precipitation, or on a different subspecies of
   big sagebrush. Prior to using these techniques to implement large-scale
   sagebrush treatments, the specific rationale for conducting them should
   be clearly identified. Large-scale projects using the techniques we
   studied would not be appropriate within sage-grouse wintering or nesting
   habitat.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US\$1.76
   billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The
   habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that
   wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant
   and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms
   in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP
   fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various
   growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing
   and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and
   facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species
   richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the
   region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of
   prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and
   to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management
   to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species
   colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established
   sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive
   observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories
   for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985
   grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding
   GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs
   with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the
   last 5 years were 57\% for adult males, 41\% for adult females, and 12\%
   for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site
   fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were
   unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species.
   Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation
   structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management
   of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation
   of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation
   physical structure rather than species composition.},

Abstract = {The signalling hypothesis of eggshell colouration in birds posits that
   females of species with blue-green eggs signal their phenotypic quality
   or the quality of their eggs to their mates through deposition of the
   antioxidant biliverdin as pigment. Males respond by investing more in
   the offspring. Through a cross-fostering experiment where we have
   exchanged whole clutches between pairs of pied flycatcher Ficedula
   hypoleuca nests, we managed to break potential associations between
   female quality and clutch chromaticity. We show that males respond to
   incubated clutches with more variable and higher peak values in
   blue-green chroma through a higher proportional investment in nestling
   provisioning on day 4 of the nestling period, when males invest more
   heavily than females in provisioning. More variable clutches show higher
   peak chroma values. We also show that egg colour during the two-week
   incubation period has a significant effect, which is not found for the
   colour of eggs during the laying period. Finally, the proportion of male
   provisioning visits affects negatively female brooding effort and
   nestling mortality, and thereby has positive effects on female fitness.
   Blue-green chroma in the pied flycatcher functions as a signal of female
   or clutch quality to males which respond by adjusting their relative
   investment with respect to total pair effort.},

Journal = {BIRD STUDY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-192},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Capsule Breeding performance was not affected, although variation in
   nestbox occupancy may result from perceived differences in protection
   from predators and insulation properties.
   Aim To assess if nestboxes of different construction and colour were
   occupied differently by breeding tits and affected breeding success.
   Methods A total of 292 nestboxes of different construction and colour
   were placed in a range of habitats and their occupancy, and the clutch
   size, brood size and number of young fledged of the birds that used them
   were measured.
   Results Overall 272 tit nests were included in the analysis. Although
   there were species-related differences in the occupancy of the different
   types of nestboxes, more tits nested in the boxes constructed from
   woodcrete (64\% of nests) compared to the wooden boxes (36\%). More tits
   nested in green (72\%) rather than brown boxes (28\%) and in boxes with
   entrance holes (68\%) rather than wedges (32\%). The clutch size, brood
   size and number of young fledged did not vary in relation to nestbox
   type.
   Conclusion Within the parameters of the experimental design of this
   study, tits are more likely to nest in woodcrete boxes than in wooden
   boxes, and in wooden boxes that are-green and have holes rather than
   brown boxes with wedge entrances. It is likely that the smaller internal
   volume, internal darkness, insulating properties and perceived
   protection from predation were the reasons for these differences.},

Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {942-947},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. The use of behavioural traits by females in signalling condition has
   been practically ignored in evolutionary theory. However, females may
   also exhibit ornaments and behavioural displays, although less
   elaborated than those of males.
   2. In this study we suggest that the carrying of feathers by spotless
   starlings Sturnus unicolor Temminck females to decorate the nest
   represents an elaborated and costly behaviour that is displayed in
   response to a courtship male behaviour: the carrying of nest green
   plants.
   3. By experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in the nests,
   to give the appearance that highly attractive males defended them, we
   induced females to increase their feather carrying rates.
   4. The amount of feathers carried to the nest was correlated to female
   reproductive experience and laying date, two variables correlated with
   female body condition. These results suggests that this behaviour may
   work as an honest indicator of female quality.
   5. We conclude that male carrying plants and female carrying feathers
   can be viewed as two sex-specific functionally related signalling
   behaviours involved in mutual courtship or status signalling.},

Volume = {146},

Pages = {365-371},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) intermingle fresh herbs,
   preferably species rich in volatile compounds, into their dry nest
   material. In a field study, we investigated whether these herbs affect
   the mite and bacteria load of the nests and the condition of the
   nestlings either directly or via parasite control. We examined the
   amount of herbs and the number of plant species males carried into their
   nests, the variation of volatile compounds in the headspace air of the
   nest boxes and mite/bacteria load of the nests throughout the season.
   The amount of herb material and the number of plant species, the number
   of substances emanated by these plants and the infestation of the nests
   with bacteria and mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) increased with season. In
   a field experiment, we exchanged natural starling nests with
   experimental nests with or without herbs. We found that the herbs had no
   effect on the mites but fewer bacteria were sampled in nests with herbs
   than in nests without herbs. The body mass of the fledging was not
   related to the season or the mite/bacteria load of the nests. However,
   nestlings from nests with herbs fledged with higher body mass than
   nestlings from nests without herbs. Both bacteria and mite load were
   related to nestling mortality. In nests containing no herbs, the numbers
   of fledglings declined significantly with the increasing mite load while
   the mites had no effect on the number of fledglings in nests with herbs.
   Thus, the nest herbs counteracted the effect of the mites. In
   conclusion, it seems that volatile herbs can reduce bacterial but not
   mite infestation of the starling nests. The positive influence of herbs
   on nestling growth indicates that herbs either directly (perhaps as
   immunostimulants) improve the condition of the nestlings and help them
   cope with the harmful effects of mites, or they provide a nest
   environment beneficial for the nestlings' development by the reduction
   of germs.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {413-420},

Abstract = {The division of labour in parental care between the two sexes varies
   between and within species. In birds, parents have been shown to invest
   more into egg production and nestling care when paired with an
   attractive rather than an unattractive mate, as predicted by the
   differential allocation hypothesis. Here we investigate variation in the
   female's and male's share of incubation behaviour, a vital, and costly,
   period of parental care during which the embryo is vulnerable to
   perturbations in developmental conditions. We manipulated the
   attractiveness of male zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, using red or
   green leg-rings. To simulate their natural social environment we allowed
   them to breed in outdoor aviaries. All males within an aviary were given
   the same coloured ring to avoid ring-colour related assortative mating.
   Males within a colony, however, were still expected to show some
   variation in attractiveness with the earliest laying females possibly
   pairing with the most attractive males. Indeed we found that both
   factors played a role in explaining female incubation effort. Among
   females mated to red ringed males, earlier laying females contributed
   significantly more to incubation than late laying females, but no such
   pattern was found in females mated to green ringed males. Overall, there
   were no differences in the level of incubation provided by both parents
   between treatment groups, suggesting some compensation within the pair.
   Hatching success was correlated with a pair's total incubation effort.
   These results suggest that variation in the division of parental care
   between the sexes is in agreement with both increased effort of females
   mated with attractive males, and females compensating for the reduced
   effort of attractive males seeking further mating opportunities. These
   two factors can act at the same time in natural populations and both
   should be considered when explaining variation in division of labour
   between the sexes.},

Title = {The recent declines of farmland bird populations in Britain: an
   appraisal of causal factors and conservation actions},
Journal = {IBIS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {146},
Number = {4},
Pages = {579-600},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, the main aspects of agricultural intensification that
   have led to population declines in farmland birds over the past 50 years
   are reviewed, together with the current state of knowledge, and the
   effects of recent conservation actions. For each of 30 declining
   species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population
   declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of
   proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4)
   specific conservation measures and (5) agri-environment schemes.
   Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects
   of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal
   factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed-eating
   birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from
   spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced
   the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been
   associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with
   reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population
   declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated
   intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced
   reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together
   with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some
   localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of
   population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all
   30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known
   (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at
   least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed
   by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been
   shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from
   options available in one or more agri-environment schemes. Four aspects
   of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population
   declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1)
   weed-control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from
   spring-sown to autumn-sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier
   ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and
   associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased
   stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the
   uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food
   available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of
   hedgerows and `rough patches', have affected smaller numbers of species,
   as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at
   least eight species have shown recent increases in their national
   population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to
   remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of
   agricultural practice is changed.},

Abstract = {We investigated nestling sex ratio variation in the green-rumped
   parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), a small neotropical parrot breeding in
   central Venezuela. There are strong theoretical reasons to predict a
   female-biased sex ratio in this system according to the local resource
   hypothesis; juvenile males are philopatric and there are high levels of
   competition between male siblings for access to breeding females. Data
   were collected from two breeding sites over a 14-year period
   incorporating 564 broods with a total of 2728 nestlings. The mean
   percentage of male nestlings across years was 51\%. Despite extreme
   hatching asynchrony in this system and increased survival of earlier
   hatched offspring, there was no bias in sex allocation associated with
   egg sequence. Patterns in sex allocation were not associated with clutch
   size, age, or size of the breeding female or breeding site. The
   potential for selective resorption of eggs was considered; however, no
   significant relationship was found between extended laying intervals and
   the sex of subsequent eggs. Together, these results suggest that female
   parrotlets are unable to regulate the sex ratio of their clutch at
   laying or that facultative manipulation of nestling sex ratio may not
   confer a fitness benefit to breeders in these populations.},

Abstract = {Some species of birds incorporate fresh green vegetation into their
   nests. The adaptive significance of this behaviour, however, is unclear.
   The ``nest protection hypothesis{''} suggests that volatile chemicals
   contained in green plants reduce populations of nest-dwelling
   ectoparasites. I tested this hypothesis with tree swallows, Tachycineta
   bicolor (Vieillot, 1808), a species that has large infestations of
   ectoparasites in its nests. I experimentally added green leaves of
   yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) to nests and compared these nests to
   control nests. My results showed that nests with yarrow had
   significantly higher levels of infestation by fleas, and yarrow had no
   effect on the number of blow flies detected. There was no effect of
   yarrow on condition of parents, size of offspring, or the probability of
   nests fledging at least one young. I did, however, find that second-year
   (SY) females with yarrow added to their nests hatched significantly more
   eggs than control SY females. In addition, pairs with yarrow added to
   their nest were significantly less likely to suffer hatching failure and
   (or) brood reduction. These beneficial effects of yarrow cannot be
   explained by reductions in numbers of fleas or blow flies, and I suggest
   that these results may be due to reductions in numbers of other types of
   parasites not quantified in my study, such as flying insects or the
   diseases that they may vector. I discuss my findings for swallows in the
   context of results from previous studies of other species that
   habitually use green plant material such as yarrow in their nests.},

   coordinates in the CIELAB colour space (blue to yellow, green to red)
   showed significant associations with male provisioning rates, explaining
   more than 20\% of variation in male parental effort. Male provisioning
   rates were positively correlated with nestling condition, thereby
   potentially contributing to female fitness. This evidence is only
   tentative until experimental confirmation, but suggests that males are
   affected by the colour of their mates' eggs, a possibility not
   considered hitherto in the study of sexual selection.},

Abstract = {Food supplementation can be an important experimental technique in
   studies of avian reproductive ecology, energetics, and parental care. We
   developed a method of food supplementation suitable for ground-foraging
   insectivorous passerines and tested it on Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)
   and Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina). We provided mealworms at
   feeding stations made of plastic transparency film covered with a thin
   layer of green moss. Feeding stations were placed on the ground or on
   logs or boulders in the vicinity of nests. Direct and indirect evidence
   suggested that 92\% of breeding Ovenbirds and 79\% of breeding Wood
   Thrushes used supplemental food. The impact of non-target consumers was
   not significant: they were observed eating mealworms at approximately
   one-third of our food-supplemented nests. However, diurnal non-target
   consumers were only detected on a single occasion for each species, and
   nocturnal consumers fed on small amounts of mealworms left after daytime
   feeding experiments. This method proved very effective for Ovenbirds and
   Wood Thrushes, and it may be applicable to other ground-foraging
   insectivorous passerines.},

Abstract = {Endogenous circannual rhythms control the time course for moult,
   migratory fattening and autumn Migration in juveniles of several bird
   species that breed in the temperate zone. Exogenous factors, such as
   daylength, can also exert a measure of control: photoperiodic cues
   detected by birds that hatch late in the season induce accelerated
   juvenile development, assuring that late-hatched young migrate at the
   same time as early-hatched young. Whether these same mechanisms of
   control also apply to birds that migrate between breeding and
   nonbreeding areas entirely within the tropics at latitudes characterized
   by little seasonal variation in photoperiod is unknown. We conducted a
   common-garden experiment in Panama (9degreesN) in which we hand-reared
   wild-caught nestling yellow-green vireos, Vireo flavoviridis, under a
   constant photoperiod and monitored them for the expression of juvenile
   moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity. Even in the absence
   of a seasonal photoperiodic cue, juveniles moulted, accumulated fat
   reserves and initiated migratory activity, suggesting endogenous control
   of these processes. Age at the onset of moult, migratory fattening and
   migratory activity were each significantly negatively correlated with
   hatch date, however, so that the expression of these three processes was
   synchronized among juveniles with respect to the time of the season. We
   suggest that the slight differences in daylength perceived either by the
   nestlings themselves in the short time before they were collected (at
   6-8 days of age) or by the adult females during egg production
   influenced rate of nestling development, thus allowing later-hatched
   young to moult, accumulate fat and migrate at a younger age than
   early-hatched young. Remarkably, photoperiod differed between the
   earliest and latest hatch dates in this study by only 33 min. (C) 2004

Abstract = {This study examines the dispersal system of Guapira opposita in a
   tropical sandy rainforest in southeast Brazil. Guapira trees produce
   small fruits with a high protein content (28.4\%) and low lipid content
   (0.3\%), and the plant is primarily dispersed by birds. Mature fruits of
   G. opposita can fall spontaneously with the pulp intact, or be dropped
   by birds with bits of pulp attached. In either case, ground-dwelling
   ants rapidly remove the fruits to their nest (93\% after 12 h). The
   ponerine ants Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata are the
   main seed vectors among the ants, and together account for 56\% (20 of
   36) of the ant-fruit interactions recorded on the forest floor.
   Individual workers of O. chelifer and P. striata transport single fruits
   to their nests. Bits of pulp are fed to larvae and worker nestmates, and
   intact seeds are discarded outside the nest. Germination success in
   Guapira is higher for cleaned seeds (pulp removed) than for seeds coated
   by pulp. Guapira seedlings and juveniles are more frequent close to
   Odontomachus nests than at sites without such nests. Soil samples from
   Odontomachus nests had greater penetrability, and higher concentrations
   of P, K, and Ca than random soil samples. Field experiments suggest that
   the association between G. opposita seedlings and O. chelifer nests can
   potentially render the plant some protection against herbivores. Results
   indicate that fruit displacement by ponerine ants play an important role
   in the biology of G. opposita seeds and seedlings in the sandy forest,
   and illustrate the complex nature of the dispersal ecology of tropical
   tree species.},

Abstract = {The function of fresh green nest material has long been debated. It has
   been suggested that it reduces the number of ectoparasites in nests and
   on nestlings (nest protection hypothesis), or is used by males to signal
   condition and paternal quality (male quality hypothesis) or is used as a
   sexually selected ornament to attract females (courtship hypothesis). We
   simultaneously tested these three hypotheses in the European starling,
   Sturnus vulgaris, in the field. Green material was carried by male
   starlings only, and mainly during nest building. It was not used to
   reduce ectoparasites. Males nesting in nestboxes that were
   experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more green
   nest material than males nesting in control boxes, and experimental
   removal and addition of green material had no effect on the number of
   ectoparasites on the nestlings or on their body mass. Furthermore, the
   amount of green material carried into a nestbox was not associated with
   male body mass, paternal incubation attendance or nestling food
   provisioning. There is two-fold experimental evidence that males use
   green plant material to attract mates. First, removal of greenery
   resulted in a significantly lower percentage of nestboxes containing a
   clutch than the control or addition treatment. Second, unpaired male
   starlings sang more and carried more greenery into a nestbox when a
   caged female was positioned adjacent to the nestbox than when a caged
   male or an empty cage was present. Paired males, when subjected to the
   same experimental design, did not respond. (C) 2004 The Association for

Abstract = {In this study, we confronted individually housed male European starlings

   Control males experienced a similar procedure, the only difference being
   that they were tested in the absence of a female. Female presence
   significantly affected both behavior and plasma T levels of male
   starlings. Experimental males spent significantly more time singing in
   the nest box and flew significantly more into the nest box with green
   nesting material during female presentations than during control
   periods. Control males never showed these mate attraction behaviors. In
   total 5 of the 16 experimental males did not respond behaviorally to the
   female stimulus bird (NR males). In contrast to T levels of control
   males, plasma T concentrations of both experimental males that did
   respond to the female (R males) and of NR males (which only perceived
   the female stimulus) were positively influenced by female presentation.
   The time spent singing in the nest box by experimental males (R and NR
   males combined) during female presence tended to be positively
   correlated with changes in plasma T levels. Finally, before introduction
   of a female, plasma T levels of R males were significantly higher than

   the presence of a female conspecific by increasing their mate attraction
   behaviors only when a threshold plasma T concentration has been reached.

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {PURPOSE: Guide wire entrapment by some older inferior vena cava (IVC)
   filters is known to occur, particularly with J-tipped wires. Three new
   IVC filters have recently been approved for use in the United States. An
   in vitro study was performed to compare the risk of engaging and
   entrapping guide wires in eight of the IVC filters currently available
   in the United States.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium Greenfield, over-the-wire
   stainless-steel Greenfield, Simon nitinol, Bird's Nest, Vena Tech LGM,
   Vena Tech LP, TrapEase, and Gunther Tulip IVC filters were deployed
   separately in an in vitro IVC flow model. Four different wires (15-mm,
   3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped, and straight) were passed 100 times each
   through the filters (50 from a jugular approach and 50 from a femoral
   approach). The frequency and specific patterns of engagement of the
   wires by the filters were recorded. Engagement was defined as a
   filter/wire interaction that caused either the filter or the wire to be
   deformed. The second part of the experiment measured the force (in
   pounds) that was required to release wires that became engaged in the
   filters with use of an electromechanical test stand with a specially
   designed low-capacity load cell of 20 pounds. Entrapment was defined as
   inability to separate an engaged wire from the filter without damage to
   either the wire or filter.
   RESULTS: Guide wire engagement occurred in all filters tested with the
   15-mm, 3-mm, and 1.5-mm J-tipped wires. The straight wire did not engage
   any of the filters. The wires engaged the TrapEase filter with the
   greatest frequency overall (72.8\%; 291 of 400). The 15-mm J wire
   engaged the filters more often than the other wires (98.5\%; 788 of
   800), but never became entrapped in a filter. The Vena Tech LP and
   Gunther Tulip filters did not entrap any of the wires. The TrapEase
   filter, the stainless-steel Greenfield filter, and the Vena Tech LGM
   filter entrapped the 3-mm and 1.5-mm J wires. The force required to
   disengage the wires from these filters exceeded 4 pounds and resulted in
   structural damage to the wire and/or filter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among the IVC filters recently approved by the Food and
   Drug Administration, the TrapEase filter entrapped 3-mm and 1.5-mm
   J-tipped guide wires, whereas the Vena Tech LP and Gunther Tulip filters
   did not. This study corroborates previously described wire entrapment by
   the stainless-steel Greenfield and Vena Tech LGM devices.},

   predator was looking away from the nest. The angle of gaze from the nest
   was associated significantly positively with the probability of entering

Abstract = {Most seasonally breeding songbirds display dramatic seasonal
   fluctuations in plasma testosterone (T) levels and mate attraction
   behaviors, including song. However, males of some songbird species, such
   as the European starling (Stumus vulgaris), continue to sing at high
   levels after the breeding season, when T levels are basal. In male
   starlings song during the breeding season functions mainly to attract
   mates, whereas song during the nonbreeding season appears unrelated to
   reproduction. This suggests that song produced in a context unrelated to
   female courtship, unlike song directed toward females, is not regulated
   by plasma T. In captive males housed in large outdoor aviaries we
   explored the relationship between plasma T and song produced during the
   breeding season within and outside a courtship context. This was
   achieved by determining the effects of castration and subsequent T
   treatment on song and mate attraction behaviors in both the presence and
   the absence of a female. Compared to intact males, castrated males did
   not show reduced song activity in the absence of a female for at least 6
   months after the operation, strongly suggesting that the expression of
   noncourtship song is not regulated by plasma T. Likewise, we found that
   experimentally elevating T levels in castrated males did not affect
   noncourtship song rates. However, control castrated males receiving
   empty implants tended to show reduced noncourtship song rates after
   implantation. This may have been due to a suppressive effect caused by
   the presence of the T-implanted castrated males in the same aviary. In
   contrast, courtship singing was clearly controlled by plasma T: it was
   abolished by castration and restored by subsequent T replacement when
   males were housed both individually and in a group situation. High
   plasma levels of T also appeared necessary for the activation of three
   other behavioral traits critical for mate attraction, namely, nesthole
   occupancy, spending time (singing) in a nesthole, and carrying green
   nesting material into a nesthole. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Abstract = {In facultative polygynous birds with biparental care, a trade-off may
   occur between male parental care and attraction of additional mates. If
   there is a cost associated with reduced male parental care, the relative
   benefit of mate attraction may be predicted to decrease as the size of a
   male's clutch or brood increases. We tested this prediction in
   monogamous pairs of facultatively polygynous European starlings (Sturnus
   vulgaris). The larger the clutch, the more time the male spent
   incubating and the less time he spent attracting an additional female
   (i.e. singing near and carrying green nesting material into adjacent
   empty nest-boxes). Reduced paternal incubation resulted in lower overall
   incubation (the female did not compensate) and lower hatching success.
   Immediately after experimental reduction of clutches, males spent
   significantly less time incubating and more time singing and carrying
   greenery, and vice versa for experimentally enlarged clutches. Males
   with experimentally reduced clutches attracted a second female more
   often than males with experimentally enlarged clutches. This is the
   first study, to our knowledge, to provide experimental evidence for an
   adjustment of paternal care and male mate-attraction effort to clutch
   size. However, a trade-off between paternal nestling provisioning and
   mate attraction was not revealed, probably due to the absence of
   unpaired females by that time in the breeding season. Experiments showed
   that the relative contribution of the male and female to nestling
   provisioning was unrelated to brood size.},

Abstract = {European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) exhibit marked sex differences in
   behavior during spring. Song activity, nest-box occupation, the carrying
   of green nesting materials into a nest hole (typical mate-attraction
   behaviors), and aggression occur much more frequently in males who also
   have higher testosterone (T)-levels than females. Here, we examined
   whether male-like concentrations of T would activate these behaviors in
   female Starlings. We treated females with implants that were either
   empty (C-females) or packed with T (T-females) during late December.
   Although elevated T-levels significantly increased song activity in
   females, the proportion of time spent singing was still much lower than
   in males. T-treatment in females also failed to induce singing behavior
   in the nest box, a typical male mate-attraction behavior. Those results
   suggest both activational and organizational effects of T on singing.
   Nest-box occupation, carrying of green nesting material into a nest
   hole, and aggressive behavior were not activated by elevated T-levels,
   indicating that sex differences in these behaviors are probably based on
   early organizational effects of steroid hormones. We also evaluated
   effects of increased T-concentrations on some physiological,
   morphological, and immunological parameters. T-treatment strongly
   suppressed tail feather regrowth after experimental plucking, and also
   delayed onset of molt of wing feathers and slowed its progress.
   T-implantation caused color of the bill to change from black to yellow,
   but did not affect body mass. Immune function was determined by using
   two indirect measures: blood composition (haematocrit and buffy coat
   values) and indications of infections. Although haematocrit and buffy
   coat values did not differ between C- and T-females, T-females were
   significantly more infected with Staphylococcus aureus than C-females at
   the end of the experiment. Received 24 January 2001, accepted 14 January

   manipulations were performed in summer 1998 on Lime Island, Michigan, to

   Three treatments (partial and complete herbicide and a control) were

   Terns on Lime Island have the greatest nest success in areas that
   contain moderate amounts (about 40\%) of total standing vegetation cover

   herbicide areas. Although the greatest number of Common Tern nests were
   located in areas with 10-30\% standing cover and >65\% litter cover
   (complete herbicide), those areas had the lowest nest success.
   Researchers should not disregard the importance of areas that typically
   support fewer nests in greater amounts of standing vegetation cover when

Abstract = {Satellite telemetry was used to record the submergence duration of green
   turtles (Chelonia mydas) as they migrated from Ascension Island to
   Brazil (N=12 individuals) while time/depth recorders (TDRs) were used to
   examine the depth distribution and dive profiles of individuals
   returning to Ascension Island to nest after experimental displacement
   (N=5 individuals). Satellite telemetry revealed that most submergences
   were short (<5 min) but that some submergences were longer (> 20 min),
   particularly at night. TDRs revealed that much of the time was spent
   conducting short (2-4 min), shallow (approximately 0.9-1.5 m) dives,
   consistent with predictions for optimisation of near-surface travelling,
   while long (typically 20-30 min), deep (typically 10-20 m) dives had a
   distinctive profile found in other marine reptiles. These results
   suggest that green turtles crossing the Atlantic do not behave
   invariantly, but instead alternate between periods of travelling just
   beneath the surface and diving deeper. These deep dives may have evolved
   to reduce silhouetting against the surface, which would make turtles
   more susceptible to visual predators such as large sharks.},

Abstract = {The nest protection hypothesis suggests that some of the fresh plant
   material, brought by some bird species to their nests, contain secondary
   compounds that repel parasites or mask the chemical cues that parasites

   of several species of aromatic plants to the nest at dusk, suggesting a
   protection against nocturnal agents such as blood-sucking flying

   plant species, alone or in mixture, was experimentally investigated in
   the mosquito Culex pipiens, using domestic chicks as bird hosts.
   Aromatic plants had a repellent effect against mosquitoes, although a
   masking effect could not be ruled out. The plant mixture was the most
   efficient, although some aromatic plants had a significant effect when

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Because most large, terrestrial mammalian predators have already been
   lost from more than 95-99\% of the contiguous United States and Mexico,
   many ecological communities are either missing dominant selective forces
   or have new ones dependent upon humans. Such large-scale manipulations
   of a key element of most ecosystems offer unique opportunities to
   investigate how the loss of large carnivores affects communities,
   including the extent, if any, of interactions at different trophic
   levels. Here, we demonstrate a cascade of ecological events that were
   triggered by the local extinction of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and
   wolves (Canis lupus) from the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
   These include (1) the demographic eruption of a large, semi-obligate,
   riparian-dependent herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), during the past
   150 yr; (2) the subsequent alteration of riparian vegetation structure
   and density by ungulate herbivory; and (3) the coincident reduction of
   avian neotropical migrants in the impacted willow communities. We
   contrasted three sites matched hydrologically and ecologically in Grand
   Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA, where grizzly bears and wolves had
   been eliminated 60-75 yr ago and moose densities were about five times
   higher, with those on national forest lands outside the park, where
   predation by the two large carnivores has been replaced by human hunting
   and moose densities were lower. Avian species richness and nesting
   density varied inversely with moose abundance, and two riparian
   specialists, Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and MacGillivray's
   Warblers (Oporornis tolmiei), were absent from Park riparian systems
   where moose densities were high. Our findings not only offer empirical
   support for the top-down effect of large carnivores in terrestrial
   communities, but also provide a scientific rationale for restoration
   options to conserve biological diversity. To predict future impacts,
   whether overt or subtle, of past management, and to restore
   biodiversity, more must be known about ecological interactions,
   including the role of large carnivores. Restoration options with respect
   to the system that we studied in the southern Greater Yellowstone
   Ecosystem are simple: (1) do nothing and accept the erosion of
   biological diversity, (2) replace natural carnivores with human
   predation, or (3) allow continued dispersal of grizzly bears and wolves
   into previously occupied, but now vacant, habitat. Although additional
   science is required to further our understanding of this and other
   terrestrial systems, a larger conservation challenge remains: to develop
   public support for ecologically rational conservation options.},

Volume = {118},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Abundances of forest birds in an unfragmented, undisturbed, and
   relatively mature temperate deciduous forest at the Hubbard Brook
   Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, changed markedly between 1969 and
   1998. Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from
   210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the
   1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly
   (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine
   remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining
   species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends
   on Brooding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30
   year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the
   White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse
   and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual
   species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding
   area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was
   temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural
   forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined
   markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot
   (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina;
   Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart,
   Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid
   successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as
   Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seirus
   aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year
   study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food
   availability and events in the migratory and winter periods.
   Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term
   pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites
   were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that
   major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and
   relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering
   habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability
   changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term
   population trends. The results also imply that any conclusions about the
   effects of other factors affecting forest bird abundances, such as
   increased nest predation or brood parasitism associated with habitat
   fragmentation, must also account for successional changes that may be
   affecting habitat suitability.},

Title = {Bioenergetics and nutrition of Mississippi Valley population Canada
   geese during winter and migration},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2001},
Number = {146},
Pages = {1-65},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Survival and reproduction of northern-nesting geese are potentially
   affected by body condition during the non-breeding season. Body
   condition is presumed to be determined by the quantity of food available
   to geese during autumn, winter, and spring migration. However, food
   resources likely do not limit populations that exploit agricultural
   systems. Other factors such as hunting, refuge management, diet quality,
   weather may affect survival and reproduction. We studied time-energy
   budgets, food intake, and body condition to determine how Canada geese
   (Branta canadensis interior) of the Mississippi Valley Population (MVP)
   acquire and utilize energy and nutrients during autumn, winter, and
   spring migration during 1984-1989.
   Abundant food and behavioral flexibility allowed MVP Canada geese to
   exist on a high nutritional plane. Food intake was sufficient to meet or
   exceed daily energy and protein requirements except during winter. High
   energy, low protein diets fueled deposition of large lipid reserves, and
   were adequate to meet protein requirements during autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin. Late migrant geese that spent autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin expended more energy (x = 583 kcal/day) yet deposited more
   lipid (x = 4.51 g) compared to early migrants that spent autumn in
   southern Illinois (x = 526 kcal/day, x = 151 g lipid) during 1984 and
   1985. Both groups averaged 4.5 hr feeding/day during autumn and consumed
   similar quantities (dry mass) of food (x = 187-190 g/day). However, late
   migrants consumed a high energy (x = 3.67 kcal/g) low protein (x = 12\%)
   diet comprised mostly of corn (x = 81\%) during autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin. Early migrants consumed a lower energy (x = 2.99 kcal/g) but
   higher protein (24\%) diet that consisted mostly of green forages (x =
   24\% dry mass) in soybeans (x = 28\%) in southern Illinois.
   Wintering geese consumed a high energy (x = 3.49 kcal/g) diet with
   intermediate protein content (x = 19\%). Corn (x = 58\%) and soybeans (x
   = 22\%) comprised most of dry matter intake during winter in southern
   Illinois when daily energy expenditure averaged 536 kcal/day. However
   food intake declined (x = 152 g food/ day) during winter when geese
   averaged 3.5 hr feeding/day. Variation in crop food energy relative to
   population energy requirements on 2 southern Illinois refuges did not
   impact body condition during 1984-1989. Nutrient reserves contributed
   minimally (<1-6\%) to meeting daily energy requirements, so geese left
   winter refuges with more lipid and similar protein masses compared to
   early autumn.
   Geese exhibited a wide range of behavioral adaptation to spatial and
   temporal variation in food resources and nutritional requirements. Late
   migrants entered winter with larger energy reserves than early migrants
   during 1984-1989. Although early and late migrants were sympatric in
   southern Illinois during winter, they converged to similar levels of
   body condition by the end of winter during 1986-1989. Late migrants
   apparently used stored energy to reduce food intake, possibly to
   minimize mortality during winter. Early migrants apparently minimized
   exposure to hunting by feeding almost entirely within refuges during
   autumn. With smaller energy reserves, early migrants maintained higher
   levels of energy intake to maintain body condition after autumn,
   possibly increasing mortality risk during winter. We expected more
   similar trends in body condition between early and late migrant Canada
   geese, and more consistent losses of nutrient reserves each year if
   winter weight declines were driven by an endogenous physiological
   rhythm. We see no reason to invoke an endogenously driven physiological
   mechanism to explain winter weight losses in MVP Canada geese. Without
   controlled metabolic experiments, we prefer the simpler and more
   plausible explanation that winter weight declines result from
   facultative adjustments of feeding behavior to weather conditions, food
   availability, and pre-winter nutrient reserves. Overwinter survival
   should be enhanced by an energetic strategy that balances potential
   benefits and risks of feeding in relation to the size of remaining
   nutrient reserves. Decline of the early migrant tradition during the
   1990's suggests that the energetic strategy of late migrants is more
   suited to recent harvest and refuge management regimes.
   Adults deposited 73\% (females) and 28\% (males) of their spring protein
   reserves while migrating between southern Illinois and east-central
   Wisconsin. Spring lipid reserves were acquired mostly (84\% in females,
   92\% in males) during a 4-5 week staging period in east-central
   Wisconsin. Juveniles deposited 41-51\% of lipid reserves and 80-91\% of
   protein between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Feeding
   time (x = 5.8 hr/day), and food intake (x = 263 g/day) increased during
   spring-staging when lipid reserves more than doubled. Spring-staging
   geese consumed a moderate energy (x = 3.25 kcal/g) low protein (x =
   13\%) diet that was more evenly composed of corn (x = 50\%), wild seeds
   and rootstocks (x = 21\%), and green forages (x = 27\%) compared to
   autumn and winter.
   Deposition of nutrient reserves was neither time- nor resource-limited
   during spring migration. Thus, food resources likely did not limit
   reproduction of MVP Canada geese under the conditions we observed during
   1984-1989. Shallow wetland and moist soil habitats can be enhanced on
   southern Illinois refuges to benefit a wider diversity of
   wetland-dependent species and provide nutritional resources for geese
   without compromising energy available to support wintering populations.
   However, geese still need an abundant source of energy during autumn and
   winter, particularly when foraging opportunities are restricted by
   inclement weather or hunting. Food restriction on winter refuges during
   long and late-closing hunting seasons in the 1990's may have contributed
   to long-term changes in autumn migration patterns and wintering
   traditions in southern Illinois. Forage and non-crop foods are essential
   sources of protein and other nutrients during all seasons. but are
   especially important during spring migration. Shallow wetlands and
   lowland pastures on private lands in central Illinois and east-central
   Wisconsin are critical sources of non-crop foods that provide essential
   nutrients that geese use to complete the nesting cycle. Thus,
   reproduction could be impaired in the future if changing land use and
   farming practices reduce availability of moist soil and lowland pasture
   habitats.},

Abstract = {Kentucky-31 tall fescue (Festuca arundicacea) was a common planting
   established on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields throughout the
   southeastern United States during the late 1980s and 1990s.
   Fescue-dominated grassland communities on CRP fields offer poor quality
   nesting, brood-rearing, and foraging habitat for northern bobwhite
   (Colinus virginianus) because of dense vegetation, high litter cover,
   low bare ground, and low plant diversity. Herbicide applications have
   been shown to reduce fescue and release early successional plant
   communities, and therefore may enhance bobwhite habitat quality.
   However, the relative efficacy of herbicide used in conjunction with
   fire has not been investigated. We tested singular and joint effects of
   herbicide (glyphosite) application and burning on vegetation in fescue
   CRP fields in east Mississippi. We tested the following 4 treatments:
   spring glyphosate application, spring bum, spring bum and glyphosate
   application, and control. All manipulations modified plant communities
   and enhanced bobwhite brood-rearing habitat to varying degrees. Spring
   bum increased bare ground and decreased litter cover (Pless than or
   equal to0.05). Spring herbicide application increased forbs, legumes,
   and annual weeds, but decreased grass and fescue canopy (Pless than or
   equal to0.05). Spring burn/herbicide application increased forbs,
   legumes, annual weeds, and bare ground but decreased grass canopy,
   fescue canopy, and litter cover (Pless than or equal to0.05). Canopy
   coverage of bobwhite food plants was greatest in spring burn/herbicide
   (Pless than or equal to0.05). Herbicide applied alone and in conjunction
   with burning enhanced bobwhite brood-rearing habitat in fescue CRP
   fields in east Mississippi by promoting early successional plant
   communities. This information has implications for implementation of
   wildlife management in federal agricultural multiple-year land
   retirement programs and other cool season grasslands not enrolled in
   federal programs.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that testosterone (T) profiles of male
   birds reflect a trade-off between mate attraction behaviours (requiring
   high T levels) and parental care activities (requiring low T levels). In
   this study, we experimentally elevated T levels of monogamous males in
   the facultatively polygynous European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and
   compared mate attraction and paternal behaviour of T-treated males with
   those of controls (C-males). T-males significantly reduced their
   participation in incubation and fed nestlings significantly less often
   than C-males. Females paired to T-treated males did not compensate for
   their mate's lower paternal effort. The observed reduction in a male's
   investment in incubating the eggs was accompanied by an increased
   investment in typical female-attracting behaviour: T-males spent a
   significantly higher proportion of their time singing to attract
   additional females. They also occupied more additional nestboxes than
   C-males, although the differences just failed to be significant, and
   carried significantly more green nesting materials into an additional
   nestbox (a behaviour previously shown to serve a courtship function).
   T-males also behaved significantly more aggressively than C-males.
   During the nestling period, the frequency of mate-attracting behaviours
   by T-treated and control males no longer differed significantly. Despite
   the reduced paternal effort by T-males and the lack of compensation
   behaviour by females, hatching and breeding success did not differ
   significantly between T- and C-pairs.},

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Pages = {582-598},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Grasslands are often characterised by small-scale mosaics in plant
   community composition that contribute to their diversity. Although
   above- and belowground biota can both cause such mosaics, few studies
   have addressed their interacting effects. We studied multi-trophic
   interactions between aboveground vertebrate grazers. subterranean ants,
   plant-pathogenic soil biota (especially nematodes) and the vegetation in
   a temperate grassland. We found that when rabbits and cattle locally
   omit vegetation patches, yellow ants (Lasius flavus) respond Lo the
   taller vegetation by digging up more sand from deeper soil layers (hence
   making taller nest mounds), probably to maintain sufficiently high soil
   temperatures. We found that this ant digging affects other soil biota,
   as the mounds contain fewer plant-parasitic and fungivore nematodes.
   Also, the mounds have lower moisture content and soil bulk densities,
   and higher pH and available nutrient content than the directly
   surrounding soil. The clonal sedge Carex arenaria grows vigorously on
   the mounds, producing more shoots and shorter rhizome internode lengths
   than in surrounding vegetation. Other plant species, such as the grass
   Festuca,rubra, dominate the surrounding vegetation. A greenhouse
   bioassay experiment revealed that harmful soil organisms (as
   plant-parasitic nematodes and pathogenic fungil) outweighed the effect
   of beneficial organisms (e.g., mycorrhizae) in this system. Rhizome
   biomass and shoot production of C. arenaria were indeed inhibited less
   by biota in soil from ant mounds than by biota in soil from the
   surrounding vegetation. However, the total biomass production of C.
   arenaria was inhibited as strongly in both soil types. F. rubra was
   inhibited more strongly by biota in the surrounding soil. We suggest
   that various direct and indirect interactions between above- and
   belowground biota can contribute to community mosaics and hence
   diversity in grasslands.},

   Sigma(s)(q,omega) are calculated for arbitrary vectors q and energy
   omega in the BCS approximation. The results obtained for q = 0 agree
   with previously obtained results. It is shown that for large wave
   numbers q, vertex corrections are negligible and Sigma(s)(q,omega)
   possesses a logarithmic singularity at omega = 2 Delta, where Delta is
   the superconducting gap. It is also shown that in systems with nesting,
   Sigma(s)(Q,omega) (where Q is the nesting vector) possesses a
   square-root singularity at omega = 2 Delta, i.e., exactly of the same
   type as at q = 0. The results are used to explain the recently published
   experimental data on phonon anomalies, observed in nickel borocarbides
   in the superconducting state, at large q. It is shown, specifically,
   that in these systems nesting must be taken into account in order to
   account for the emergence of a narrow additional line in the phonon
   spectral function S(q,omega) approximate to -pi(-1)Im D-s(q,omega),
   where D-s(q,omega) is the phonon Green's function, at temperatures T <
   T-c. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[}S1063-7761(99)02005-3].},

Abstract = {The aims of agriculture, wildlife management and nature conservation are
   not entirely similar, yet their interests coincide in providing the
   essential conditions for our natural wildlife. The natural living-space
   of wildlife is shrinking due to human activities. 70\% of the hunting
   areas are cultivated today. The majority of wild animals is squeezed
   into the plough-lands, where they are threatened not only by harvesters
   and mowers, but also by the adverse effects of pesticides and chemical
   fertilizers. The experiment was aimed at modelling the effects of NIKROL
   - UAN solution on chick embryos. In alfalfa-fields different solutions
   of NIKROL are used for manuring: concentrated solution for basic
   fertilization, 50\% solution for mulching and 20\% solution for foliar
   fertilization. The time of foliar fertilization coincides with the
   egg-laying and hatching period of pheasants and partridges, thus
   endangering the reproductive success of these species. In the experiment
   the effects of different NIKROL - UAN solutions (concentrated, 50\%,
   20\%, 1\%) on embryonic development were determined.
   Main results: Concentrated, 50\% and 20\% solutions of NIKROL injected
   into the eggs caused 87-96\% embryonic mortality right after treatment.
   Embryomortality slightly decreased (27-80\%) when eggs were immersed in
   the solutions, but still was dose-dependent. 29 different morphological
   deformities were detected of which the most frequent ones were stunted
   growth (16\%) and cyst over the embryo (14\%).
   Statistical analysis showed that in the second 5 days of incubation
   NICROL did not influence the weight gain of living embryos when eggs
   were immersed in the solutions.
   NIKROL - UAN solution proved to be dangerous to small games nestling in
   alfalfa- and winter-cereal fields. This fact calls for the extention of
   research on the postembryonic development of birds, and other animal
   species (deer, rabbit, etc.). Neglecting fertilization is inconceivable
   these days, bur the application of fertilizers should be carried out
   with circumspection. In order to protect birds foliar fertilization
   should be completed at a time not coinciding with the egg-laying and
   hatching period. The protection of other animal species accounts for the
   reduction of the amount of fertilizer applied. Nowadays there are
   numerous biological methods for nutrient supply and yield-increase
   (green manure, compost, bacterial inoculation of soil, etc.).},

Pages = {709-719},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that the white coloration of Pieridae butterflies
   is a warning signal and therefore all white Pieridae could profit from a
   mimetic resemblance. We tested whether green-veined white (Pieris napi)
   and orange-tip (Anthocharis cardamines) butterflies benefit from white
   coloration. We compared their relative acceptability to wild, adult pied
   flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by offering live A. cardamines and P.
   napi together with two non-aposematic butterflies on the tray attached
   to birds' nesting boxes. Experienced predators equally attacked white
   and non-white butterflies, and the order of attack among the Pieridae
   was random. If anything, there was a slight indication that the female
   A. cardamines was the least favoured prey. Since birds did not avoid
   white coloration, we compared the palatability of these two species
   against known palatable and unpalatable butterflies by presenting them
   to great tits (Parus major). Pieris brassicae, which has been earlier
   described as unpalatable, was also included in the palatability test.
   However, there were no significant differences in the palatability of
   the butterflies to birds, and even P. brassicae was apparently palatable
   to the great tits. Our results do not unambiguously support the
   hypothesis that the white coloration of Pieridae would signal
   unpalatability. Nevertheless, in our last experiment, pied flycatchers
   often rejected or left untouched free flying P. napi and A. cardamines.
   This suggests that other features in a more natural situation, such as
   the agile flight pattern or odours might still make them unprofitable to
   birds.},

Abstract = {Chemical repellents may provide an effective and humane method of
   reducing; bird damage to crops via modification of the feeding behavior
   of the target species. We observed behavior of free-living birds, in
   particular greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), blue tits (Parus caeruleus)
   and great tits (P. major), feeding on peanuts contained in wire-mesh
   feeders set out in 5 rows at 5-m intervals progressing away from the
   edge of woodland. Two identical patches of peanuts were available and
   were approximately 300 m apart. Prior to treatment, all birds preferred
   to feed closest to the woodland. We applied cinnamamide (0.6\%
   mass/mass), an avian repellent, to peanuts in the preferred rows of 1
   patch (row 1 nest to the wood iri the first veer of the experiment, and
   rows 1-3 in the second year). All birds avoided treated peanuts. When
   row I was treated, the number of tits feeding on rows 2-3 increased, and
   many of the green finches moved away from the treated patch to the
   untreated patch. Whem rows 1-3 were treated, a few tits moved Lo feed on
   row 1, but most birds left the treated patch and numbers increased on
   the untreated patch, which suggested they flew to the untreated patch.
   Modifications of feeding behavior brought about by the presence of
   cinnamamide varied among species. Such modifications may have been
   related to differences in social organization: tits were relatively
   solitary feeders and were also probably establishing territories at the
   time of the experiment (Feb-Mar), whereas greenfinches fed and flew in
   large flocks. Thus, it wits likely easier for greenfinches to fly
   between patches than the tits. Only when eating untreated peanuts at
   their ``local{''} patch involved feeding greater than or equal to 20 m
   from cover did most tits leave the patch. probably for the untreated
   patch. Bird pests tend to be flock feeders, thus an effective and
   appropriately formulated chemical repellent may be an effective tool for
   modifying the behavior of bird pests in order to reduce damage.},

Journal = {RADIATION RESEARCH},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Electrons and holes generated in irradiated DNA migrate to stable
   trapping sites. Protonation and deprotonation reactions at these sites
   promote the trapping of electrons and holes, thereby inhibiting further
   migration. The extent of migration determines the final distribution of
   damage in irradiated DNA. In this study, electron and hole migration is
   investigated in a crystalline DNA hexamer intercalated with an
   anthracycline drug. The intercalator is no further than 2 base pairs
   away from any DNA base. From EPR measurements, there is no evidence of
   DNA-centered radicals in the irradiated DNA hexamer. The aromatic region
   of the anthracycline intercalator evidently sequesters most or all of
   the electrons and most of the holes. Further hole trapping and radical
   stabilization appear to occur on the anthracycline's amino sugar group,
   which is nestled in the minor groove of the hexamer. The relatively
   large yield of this proposed amino sugar radical suggests that holes
   generated in the DNA solvation shell migrate to the amino sugar, where
   they become trapped. This would be the first observation of a radical
   formed by the direct effect of low-dose, low-LET radiation that is
   trapped within the DNA helix, yet lies outside of the stacked bases.
   With respect to holes generated in the DNA bases at 4 K, we conclude
   that most, if not all, are capable of migrating to an intercalator less
   than or equal to 2 base pairs away. With respect to dry electrons, we
   conclude that anthracycline competes effectively for electron trapping
   over a region of at least 2 base pairs; our experiments cannot
   distinguish between electron attachment to the bases followed by
   transfer to the intercalator and direct attachment to the intercalator.

Abstract = {For both egg production and laboratory research, Japanese quail
   (Coturnix japonica) are typically housed in battery cages without nest
   boxes. In such cages the quail hens show symptoms of pre-laying
   restlessness, The inability to perform normal pre-laying behaviour is
   regarded as one of the most important problems for the welfare of caged
   laying hens. The present study aimed at identifying key nest site
   stimuli for quails, to enable nest boxes to be designed for alternative
   housing systems. Groups of hens were kept in pens containing litter,
   nest boxes and dustbathing boxes. The type of nest box was varied
   between pens, and the incidence of eggs laid outside the nest boxes
   (floor-eggs) was recorded over periods of 15 days. In experiment 1 (8
   groups of 30 hens), both the nature of the top of the nest boxes (closed
   or with slits) and the type of substrate in the nest boxes (artificial
   turf or hay) had a significant effect on the percentage of floor-eggs.
   Nest boxes with a top with slits and filled with hay were best accepted
   for laying. Nest boxes situated in the corners of the pens were
   significantly selected more often for egg laying than more central
   nests. In experiment 2 (8 groups of 14 hens), neither the nature of the
   sides of the nest boxes (closed or with slits) nor the colour of the
   nest boxes (green or brown) had a significant effect on the incidence of
   floor-eggs. In experiment 3 (16 groups of 14 hens with 2 or 3 cocks),
   the percentage of floor-eggs was significantly lower in pens with high
   (170 lux) than with low (15 lux) light intensity. There was also a
   tendency for nest boxes filled with chaff to be better accepted than
   nest boxes filled with hay. In experiments 2 and 3, in pens with floors
   half litter and half of perforated plastic more floor-eggs were found on
   the litter. Few eggs were laid in the dustbathing boxes in any
   experiment. This study shows that Japanese quail lay up to 90\% of eggs
   in nest boxes provided these are properly designed. It should therefore
   be feasible to develop housing systems with nests for Japanese quail
   which may replace conventional battery cages. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {We examined whether the early onset of incubation serves to protect eggs
   from the dangers imposed by conspecifics in the green-rumped parrotlet,
   Forpus passerinus, a small neotropical parrot that lays a large clutch
   and begins incubation on the first egg. Nestboxes with eggs were
   installed and their fate was followed for 72 h to determine whether egg
   destruction and nest site take-overs occurred as predicted by the Egg
   Protection and Limited Breeding Opportunities Hypotheses, or whether
   additional eggs appeared in the boxes as predicted by the Brood
   Parasitism Hypothesis. Eggs were destroyed at 40.6\% of 69 experimental
   boxes but at only 4.5\% of control nests occupied by laying pairs. No
   eggs were laid in the experimental boxes. Egg destruction at
   experimental nests occurred during daylight hours and all mortality was
   caused by green-rumped parrotlets. Over 75\% of the nests were destroyed
   by male-female pairs prospecting for nest sites, and the remainder were
   destroyed by male-male pairs. Lone males never destroyed eggs, although
   they frequently visited experimental boxes. Two of three failures at
   control nests were the result of nocturnal predators, and the other nest
   was apparently destroyed by parrotlets. There was no significant
   difference between experimental and control boxes in the frequency of
   visitations by lone males, male-female pairs and male-male pairs.
   Although experimental boxes that parrotlets visited were discovered
   quickly after placement, parrotlets were usually slow to enter them ((X)
   over bar = 5.8 h after discovery, range 0.3-23.5 h). Control nests were
   rarely left unattended: females spent nearly 75\% of their time in the
   box, and pairs were typically absent for short intervals (median=7.5
   min). Control females responded to intruding parrotlets by remaining in
   the box 94\% of the time when alone, whereas males actively displaced
   and chased intruding parrotlets 66\% of the time. Parrotlets that
   visited control nests approached the box significantly less often than
   those visiting experimental boxes. To ensure the survival of eggs,
   parrotlet parents must begin incubating eggs or guarding nests soon
   after laying to minimize destruction of clutches, loss of nest sites, a
   decline in the viability of their eggs and the time that all nestlings
   are exposed to predators. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {Rubbery wood is a severe disease which affects both apple and pear trees
   and may cause severe losses in some countries. The affected plants show
   a partial lack of lignification of young branches which gives the plant
   a typical prostrate appearance. In longitudinal sections of flower
   petioles and green prebursted shoots from grafts or diseased trees,
   strong fluorescent areas associated with DNA due to phytoplasmas or to
   other infectious agents were observed using fluorescent microscopy-DAPI
   technique. Round structures resembling phytoplasmas were also observed
   under the scanning electron microscope. Further analyses were performed
   to verify the presence of phytoplasma and allow their molecular
   identification. Samples from two source plants from the Czech Republic
   and one from Canada were employed in direct and nested polymerase chain
   reaction assays together with apple proliferation samples and group
   specific control phytoplasma strains as positive controls. General
   ribosomal primer pairs employed were R16F1/R0 and R16F2/R2, while
   group-specific primer pairs were R16(I)F1/R1, R16(III)F2/R1, R16(V)F1/R1
   and R16(X)F1/R1. A DNA fragment of 1.2 kb was produced from some of the
   rubbery wood samples and from apple proliferation samples as well as
   from the positive controls when nested PCR was carried out with the
   primer pair R16F2/R2. The amplification with specific primers yielded a
   1.1 kb fragment from the rubbery wood samples amplified using primer
   pairs R16(I)F1/R1. RFLP analysis confirmed that phytoplasmas that belong
   to the aster yellows group (16SrI) were present. PCR experiments with
   primers that amplify a chromosomal portion of aster yellows group
   phytoplasmas followed by Southern hybridization with the homologous DNA
   probe confirmed the presence, in some of the apple rubbery wood samples,
   of phytoplasma that belong to the aster yellows group.},

   about 600 ha between 1941 and 1989, and alkaline flat decreased by >240
   ha. Field experiments were conducted to determine predator and flooding
   impacts on artificial nests that simulated Least Tern (Sterna

   Experimental nest plots were placed on the alkaline Rat adjacent to, 500
   m from, and 1000 m from herbaceous rangeland, shrub rangeland, and
   stream habitat that was not associated with vegetation. Plot comparisons

   flooding (P < 0.05) than nests at 500 or 1000 m from vegetation.
   Encroaching vegetation will likely continue to reduce habitat for

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: The filtering efficiency of the stainless-steel
   Greenfield filter was evaluated in a modified flow model. A total of
   2,100 clots were injected. In addition, controlled parameters simulating
   in vivo conditions were selected to appreciate clot-trapping capacity
   and pressure gradients for nine filters in horizontal and vertical
   positions, by using small (3 x 30 mm) and medium-sized (5 x 30 mm)
   clots. Statistical evaluation was performed for 3,600 clot deliveries.
   RESULTS: Depending on experimental conditions, the clot-trapping
   capacity of the Greenfield filter varied greatly (0\%-78\%) by using
   small and medium clots. Bird's Nest and Simon nitinol filters
   demonstrated the highest filtering efficiency (94\%-100\%) for small
   clots. Medium clots were effectively captured by Bird's Nest, Simon
   nitinol, Antheor, and Gunther Tulip filters (79\%-100\%).
   CONCLUSION: Experimental parameters influence a filter's clot-trapping

Abstract = {1. I experimentally examined components of the stimulus-response
   mechanism and their effects on feeding rates to nestlings in cooperative
   singular-breeding green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus, and showed
   that both auditory and visual stimuli played important roles.
   2. Breeding status did not influence the way in which adults responded
   to the various stimuli.
   3. Adult woodhoopoes fed foreign nestlings which had been transferred as
   frequently and with as much food as their own nestlings.
   4. Observational evidence from two different studies showed that
   recent-immigrant nonbreeders provided young with as much food as other
   established nonbreeders. Thus, there is no evidence that nonparental
   feeding behaviour is related to nest-site specificity, kin
   discrimination, or prior association with breeders in this species.

Abstract = {Many passerine birds with open cup-shaped nests lay blue or blue-green
   eggs. In thrushes, blue eggs may be cryptic and provide camouflage by
   imitating spots of light on green leaves. Alternatively, egg coloration
   may be selectively neutral because nest predators detect nests and not
   eggs, or it may be maladaptive because organisms are not always well
   adapted to their present environment. I evaluated these hypotheses by
   studying predation on artificial song thrush (Turdus philomelos) nests
   with quail eggs, painted either white, blue, or spotted (cryptic to a
   human eye). Corvids were the major nest predators. For concealed as well
   as exposed nests, I found no differences in the predation rates of nests
   with white, blue, or spotted eggs. Predators apparently detected the
   nests, and not the eggs, first. In a second experiment, I placed egg
   groups without nests in trees to study the effect of color per se. The
   predation rate of the spotted egg groups was significantly lower than
   that of the white and blue egg groups, for concealed as well as exposed
   egg groups. These results suggest that blue eggs in the song thrush are
   not cryptic but may be selectively neutral or even maladaptive with
   regard to nest predation.},

   STARLING},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {The use of green nesting material is widespread among birds.  Recent
   evidence suggests that birds use secondary chemicals contained in green
   plants to control ectoparasites.  We manipulated green nesting material
   and ectoparasites of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to test two
   hypotheses:  (1) ectoparasites adversely affect prefledging survival and
   morphometrics or postfledging survival, and (2) green nesting material
   ameliorates the effects of ectoparasites.  We recorded fat score,
   numbers of scabs, tarsal length, body mass, and hematocrit level on each
   nestling 17 days after hatching.  We also fitted each nestling with
   unique patagial tags and resighted the starlings for 6-8 weeks after
   fledging to estimate survival and sighting rates.  Nests devoid of green
   nesting material and dusted with the insecticide, carbaryl, had fewer
   high ectoparasite infestations, and nestlings had significantly lower
   scab scores, and significantly higher body masses than nestlings in
   undusted boxes.  However, there was no difference in postfledging
   survival between birds from carbaryl-treated and undusted nests.  There
   also was no difference in prefledging survival and morphometrics or
   postfledging survival between nestlings from boxes with and without
   green nesting material.  These results do not support the hypothesis
   that starlings use green nesting material to control nest ectoparasites.
   We suggest an alternative hypothesis; green nesting material is used for
   mate selection or pairbonding in the starling.},

Title = {GREAT-LAKES EMBRYO MORTALITY, EDEMA, AND DEFORMITIES SYNDROME (GLEMEDS)
   IN COLONIAL FISH-EATING BIRDS - SIMILARITY TO CHICK-EDEMA DISEASE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {455-520},
Abstract = {Several species of colonial fish-eating birds nesting in the Great Lakes
   basin, including herring gulls, common terns and double-crested
   cormorants, have exhibited chronic impairment of reproduction. In
   addition to eggshell thinning caused by high levels of DDT and
   metabolites, the reproductive impairment is characterized by high
   embryonic and chick mortality, edema, growth retardation, and
   deformities, hence the name Great Lakes embryo mortality, edema, and
   deformities syndrome (GLEMEDS). The hypothesis has been advanced that
   GLEMEDS in colonial fish-eating birds resembles chick-edema disease of
   poultry and has been caused by exposure to chick-edema active compounds
   that have a common mode of action through the cytochrome P-448 system.
   Detailed evidence has been collected from the following three groups of
   studies on herring gulls in the lower Great Lakes during the early
   1970s; Forster's terns in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1983; and
   double-crested cormorants and Caspian terns in various locations in the
   upper Great Lakes from 1986 onwards.
   It has proved difficult to establish not only the onset of the disease
   in the various species at various locations but also the period in which
   chick-edema active compounds were released. Anecdotal evidence suggested
   that serious egg mortality in Lake Ontario herring gulls first occurred
   in 1966, though the signs of chick-edema disease were not looked for
   until 1974. Only indirect evidence is available on the date of the
   release of one of the presumed causal agents,
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, but highest levels may have
   occurred in the early to mid 1960s. More reliable data show that the
   onset of the improvement of reproduction of Lake Ontario herring gulls
   coincided with the declines in organochlorine compounds and particularly
   2,3,7,8-TCDD and PCB. Similarly, information on the onset of the disease
   and exposures in the Forster's tern and double-crested cormorants in
   Green Bay is uncertain but bird banders did not observe deformities
   until the 1970s, which corresponds with the onset of high levels of PCB.
   If the disappearance of the Caspian tern from Saginaw Bay in the mid
   1960s corresponds with the onset of GLEMEDS at that location, then there
   is a close temporal relationship to the onset of high PCB levels.
   Chick-edema disease is difficult to diagnose because there is no
   specific lesion, but rather there is a suite of lesions. GLEMEDS is
   characterized by an elevated incidence of embryonic and chick mortality,
   growth retardation, and developmental abnormalities, including bill
   deformities, club feet, missing eyes, and defective feathering, and
   there is also subcutaneous, percardial, and peritoneal edema, liver
   enlargement, liver necrosis, and porphyria. These signs conform to the
   known symptoms of chick-edema disease.
   A variety of chick-edema active compounds, including
   non-ortho-substituted PCBs and dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans substituted
   at the lateral positions, produce chick-edema disease. The active
   compounds have specific conformational requirements.
   In considering evidence on the strength of association, the embryos and
   chicks of herring gulls from Lake Ontario and Forster's terns from Green
   Bay had a significant increase in the incidence of the lesions compared
   to the reference colonies. Similarly, the incidence of bill
   abnormalities was significantly elevated in Great Lakes colonies of
   double-crested cormorants particularly for Green Bay, Wisconsin. There
   was a significant dose-response relationship between the incidence of
   embryonic mortality in cormorant eggs and the presence of chick-edema
   active compounds expressed in 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents.
   There is a high degree of consistency on replication. The disease has
   been found in a variety of species in a variety of locations, by
   different observers using different study designs. Outbreaks of the
   disease have occurred at different times and seem only to be related to
   exposures of developing embryos to high levels of chick-edema active
   compounds.
   The new facts, that embryos and chicks of colonial, fish-eating birds
   can exhibit signs resembling chick-edema disease when exposed to
   chick-edema active compounds, cohere with existing biological theory,
   experience, and experimentation. There are plausible routes of exposure
   and sources of these compounds to the Great Lakes, and statistically
   significant dose-response relationships have been demonstrated.},
